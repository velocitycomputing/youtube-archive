## Summary

Matt Pocock argues that developers obsess over AI models when they should focus equally on the "harness"—the prompts, skills, codebase design, and environment surrounding the model. He distinguishes between tactical programming (day-to-day coding) and strategic programming (architecture, velocity, design decisions), noting that AI handles tactical work well, so senior developers must excel at strategic programming to leverage AI effectively. He demonstrates his "teach" skill, a stateful learning tool that creates personalized curricula based on a learner's mission and uses proven teaching principles like spaced repetition and zone of proximal development. He also discusses skill architecture: "procedure" skills (user-invoked, keeping humans in control) versus "ability" skills (AI-invoked), and his preference for procedures. His setup uses Claude Code with Opus 4.8 on medium effort locally, plus Sandcastle to run parallel agents in sandboxed environments on GitHub Actions.

To level up with AI, invest in domain expertise and codebase architecture rather than chasing new models—your skills are the ceiling on what AI can achieve. Create reusable procedure skills for your workflow (e.g., "grill me" for adversarial interviews before implementation). Front-load strategic work: use skills to interview the AI until you reach 98% shared understanding on design decisions, then decompose work into tightly-scoped tasks for AI to execute. Keep your codebase clean, well-tested, and documented so AI can navigate it effectively. For complex work, use sandboxed agents (Sandcastle or similar) to parallelize tasks without constraining local resources. Finally, stay in control as the orchestrator—don't delegate your thinking to the model; use it to execute your well-scoped strategic vision.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Everyone's obsessed with the uh model
[00:00:02] and I think they should be more
[00:00:04] interested in the harness, what you can
[00:00:06] do to get the most out of the harness,
[00:00:08] giving it the right prompts, giving it
[00:00:09] the right skills to work with and
[00:00:11] improving the environment in which the
[00:00:13] model runs. As I sort of said with
[00:00:14] Fable, like the model is useful, but I
[00:00:18] think the harness has an equal amount of
[00:00:21] work and you have much more control of
[00:00:22] the harness than you do the model.
[00:00:24] People are focused on the wrong thing.
[00:00:26] They're looking at the big shiny new
[00:00:28] thing when in fact just focus on the
[00:00:30] stuff that's been working for 30 40
[00:00:32] years, you know, and it really does
[00:00:35] work. Like people ask me all the time,
[00:00:37] how do you optimize for token spend?
[00:00:38] Have a code base that's easier to make
[00:00:40] changes in,
[00:00:42] >> right, Matt? So what's going to be the
[00:00:44] main difference between people who use
[00:00:45] AI to get insanely ahead and the
[00:00:48] majority of people who only get a small
[00:00:49] boost from it? So in his book philosophy
[00:00:53] of software design, John Asterout talks
[00:00:55] about the difference between tactical
[00:00:57] and strategic programming. So I find
[00:01:00] this distinction so useful when thinking
[00:01:02] about AI because tactical programming is
[00:01:04] all about the on the ground day-to-day
[00:01:06] stuff, the actual writing of the code,
[00:01:08] the actual messing about with the
[00:01:10] syntax, figuring out bugs as they come
[00:01:12] up, and actually creating the code,
[00:01:14] creating the commits. Strategic
[00:01:16] programming is winning the war, not the
[00:01:18] battle. It's longer term thinking. It's
[00:01:20] the general sitting right at the top.
[00:01:22] How does the codebase need to look what
[00:01:24] um strategies can I use to improve our
[00:01:26] velocity? And for me, strategic
[00:01:30] programming has always been the most
[00:01:31] interesting, the most exciting. That's
[00:01:33] how I was thinking even when I was a
[00:01:34] junior. How can we increase our
[00:01:36] velocity? How can we do more with less?
[00:01:38] And AI has basically eaten tactical
[00:01:41] programming. It's gone, right? It's all
[00:01:43] gone. So AI is just better at doing
[00:01:45] tactical programming than you are
[00:01:47] because it can do it for cheaper, right?
[00:01:49] And so you need to be great at strategic
[00:01:53] programming in order to get the most out
[00:01:55] of this infinite fleet of tactical
[00:01:57] programmers that you now have access to.
[00:01:59] >> So does that mean knowing how to
[00:02:01] orchestrate these agents plus some like
[00:02:04] fundamentals of software design,
[00:02:06] codebased architecture, like how would
[00:02:07] you break that down into like these
[00:02:08] specific skills that people can learn?
[00:02:10] >> Yeah, great question. So strategic
[00:02:13] programming really hasn't changed in AI,
[00:02:15] right? AI is just um all we're doing is
[00:02:18] instead of delegating to junior or
[00:02:20] mid-level programmers, we're delegating
[00:02:22] to AI instead. So the things that you
[00:02:26] need to do good delegation are still the
[00:02:29] same. You need to design the hard parts
[00:02:31] up front. You need to make sure those
[00:02:33] tasks are really, really well scoped.
[00:02:35] You need to be thinking about the
[00:02:36] interfaces between all of the modules in
[00:02:38] your codebase. You know, you need to be
[00:02:40] thinking about test scenes and good
[00:02:41] tests. You need to essentially design a
[00:02:44] codebase that's easy to work in and have
[00:02:46] just enough documentation that can point
[00:02:48] AI to the right places where it's going
[00:02:50] to make those changes and make them
[00:02:51] effectively.
[00:02:52] >> I think everybody at this point agrees
[00:02:53] that the AI progress is very fast if not
[00:02:56] speeding up. So, I think a lot of people
[00:02:58] also miss the part of upskilling
[00:03:00] themselves, right? Because the like yeah
[00:03:03] you can pay for subscriptions you know
[00:03:04] you can get the latest tools but
[00:03:06] ultimately anybody can do that but there
[00:03:07] is still going to be people who use
[00:03:09] these tools to massively grow their
[00:03:11] business you know to ship more and
[00:03:12] better software than ever before and
[00:03:14] there's going to be people who like try
[00:03:15] it a bit and you know maybe use the free
[00:03:17] version or the cheaper model. So how
[00:03:19] would you advise people to start
[00:03:21] teaching themselves to be better?
[00:03:24] >> Yeah. Um people ask me all the time like
[00:03:25] because you know I sell developer
[00:03:27] courses right? So I'm sort of, you know,
[00:03:29] you can take my advice here with a pinch
[00:03:30] of salt, but I personally feel that my
[00:03:35] skills are a multiplier for AI, right? I
[00:03:38] if I'm able to oversee a codebase and
[00:03:41] think about how like things should be
[00:03:43] built and just tell AI how to do it,
[00:03:45] then a AI just has so much richer
[00:03:47] context to work with. And I think of
[00:03:51] this, I mean, I see this everywhere and
[00:03:53] people uh like CTO's and like people I
[00:03:56] talk to at conferences tell me this all
[00:03:57] the time is that AI makes senior
[00:03:59] developers just 10 times better. And it
[00:04:01] sort of doesn't make sense to hire that
[00:04:03] many juniors anymore because juniors get
[00:04:06] a little boost from AI, but seniors just
[00:04:08] get this ridiculous huge boost from it
[00:04:10] and they can do so much more with it. So
[00:04:13] your skills are the ceiling on what AI
[00:04:15] can do. And if your skills are low, then
[00:04:17] AI is not going to be able to go past
[00:04:19] that, you know. So getting good with AI
[00:04:22] is really about getting good at your
[00:04:24] domain, getting good at what um AI is
[00:04:28] going to be doing for you. So a better
[00:04:30] teacher can use AI to teach people
[00:04:33] better than uh a random can, you know.
[00:04:36] So I think skills are more important now
[00:04:39] than they used to be because again, you
[00:04:41] just have this multiplier available to
[00:04:43] you and you can delegate more. So you
[00:04:45] recently shipped the new teach skill,
[00:04:47] right? Can you tell us more about that?
[00:04:48] If you've ever tried pulling search data
[00:04:50] from the web at scale, you know it's a
[00:04:53] nightmare. You write a scraper, it works
[00:04:55] for a week, but then the layout changes.
[00:04:57] Then you hit captures, your proxies get
[00:04:59] blocked, rate limits everywhere, and
[00:05:01] suddenly you find yourself maintaining
[00:05:03] scraping infrastructure instead of
[00:05:05] building the actual project. This is
[00:05:07] where SER API comes in. It gives you
[00:05:09] clean structured search results from
[00:05:11] Google, Bing, Yahoo, and more through a
[00:05:14] single API call. You send a request and
[00:05:16] you get back a clean JSON object with
[00:05:19] exactly the data you want. No capture
[00:05:21] solving, no rotating proxies, no broken
[00:05:24] HTML. They handle all of it. And for AI
[00:05:27] work, this is huge. Say you're building
[00:05:29] an agent that needs live information.
[00:05:31] Just use their Google search API. Or
[00:05:33] maybe you're training an AI model that
[00:05:35] needs a data set. Their Google Images
[00:05:37] API gives you pre-classified titles,
[00:05:39] URLs, and thumbnails ready to go. A ton
[00:05:41] of production agents already use SER API
[00:05:44] as one of their core tools, and you can
[00:05:46] get started with 250 free credits. No
[00:05:49] credit card required. Just scan the QR
[00:05:52] code on screen or click the first link
[00:05:54] below the video. Oh, and a huge thank
[00:05:55] you to Surf API for sponsoring this
[00:05:57] video.
[00:05:58] >> Yeah, I know a lot about teaching. I've
[00:06:00] been a teacher for 10 years, actually.
[00:06:01] So I was teaching uh singing and voice
[00:06:04] when I was uh just straight out of
[00:06:06] university. Then I became a developer
[00:06:08] and now I teach developers. I've been
[00:06:09] doing that for the last four years. So I
[00:06:11] know a lot about teaching and I I
[00:06:13] thought okay what if I take some of the
[00:06:15] teaching principles that I know about
[00:06:17] such as the zone of proximal development
[00:06:19] such as the difference between knowledge
[00:06:20] skills and wisdom encode that into a
[00:06:23] skill and essentially use it to create a
[00:06:26] course on the fly about any topic and
[00:06:29] that's what I've done and it's extremely
[00:06:31] effective. I've actually been learning
[00:06:33] I'm teaching myself Rubik's cube from
[00:06:35] this. I can solve a Rubik's cube now
[00:06:37] from memory thanks to this skill. And
[00:06:39] I've been using this for all sorts of
[00:06:41] stuff. So yesterday I was I was messing
[00:06:43] about with what it might look like to
[00:06:47] ask the teach skill how to become a
[00:06:50] senior developer. And it basically went
[00:06:52] on this big journey looking at a bunch
[00:06:54] of trusted resources getting a big sort
[00:06:56] of curriculum together and just produced
[00:06:58] something that was gorgeous. And so that
[00:07:02] >> absolutely let's give it a go.
[00:07:04] >> Yeah. Yeah, I think people would love to
[00:07:05] see that.
[00:07:06] >> Definitely. Okay, so uh David, what do
[00:07:10] you want to learn?
[00:07:10] >> Let's do like systems design.
[00:07:12] >> I tell you what, I mean I I I I've got
[00:07:14] an idea here, which is that a lot of
[00:07:16] people come to me. I I teach courses for
[00:07:19] engineers, really, people who already
[00:07:20] know how to be an engineer.
[00:07:22] >> I'm intrigued by if this skill can teach
[00:07:26] you basically the basics of engineering,
[00:07:28] you know what I mean? To fill in the
[00:07:30] gaps that you might have if you're a
[00:07:32] vibe coder, you know? So, I'm going to
[00:07:34] pretend that I'm a vibe coder. I'm going
[00:07:36] to invoke the teach skill. I'm inside an
[00:07:38] empty directory here and I'm just going
[00:07:40] to let it roll. So, I'm going to dictate
[00:07:43] something out and let's see how it goes.
[00:07:45] I am a vibe coder and I want to fill in
[00:07:48] my knowledge gap so that I can ship
[00:07:49] better software. I know some very, very
[00:07:53] basic CLI commands and I know just about
[00:07:56] enough to read some code and use the
[00:07:59] terminal, but that's about it. What do
[00:08:01] you think I should learn to um develop
[00:08:03] my skills next?
[00:08:06] >> So, I'm going to put that
[00:08:07] >> a simple prompt, plain English. Anybody
[00:08:09] can ask you this.
[00:08:10] >> Exactly. And it's just a a very very
[00:08:12] simple request. And I'm not really
[00:08:14] talking about the subject that I'm
[00:08:15] trying to learn. I'm talking about my
[00:08:17] mission, the thing I want to get out of
[00:08:19] this, the reason I'm coming to this
[00:08:21] session with the teacher today. And you
[00:08:24] can think of this really as a
[00:08:25] collaborative effort. Basically, I am
[00:08:26] talking to a teacher and the agent is my
[00:08:29] teacher. and it should know how best to
[00:08:32] teach me.
[00:08:33] >> And it's good that you you brought it up
[00:08:35] and you created the skill recently
[00:08:37] because literally I was thinking about
[00:08:38] this yesterday, right? Especially when
[00:08:40] Fable came out. I was like, how can I
[00:08:42] upskill myself to get the most out of it
[00:08:44] cuz like I I I know I'm not where I can
[00:08:46] be. You know, there's people much better
[00:08:48] than me, much more skilled than me. So
[00:08:49] like it's it's great timing that you
[00:08:51] have this skill now.
[00:08:52] >> Good. Well, this um so it's basically
[00:08:55] saying, okay, I've checked the
[00:08:56] workspace. It's a blank slate. the teach
[00:08:58] skill, you need to run it in a workspace
[00:08:59] because it saves a bunch of information
[00:09:01] in that workspace. Okay?
[00:09:03] >> And so for a vibe coder who can read
[00:09:04] code and use a basic terminal, the
[00:09:05] highest leverage gap is almost never
[00:09:07] more syntax. It's the stuff around the
[00:09:09] code that lets you ship without fear.
[00:09:11] That's 100% true. So git, reading
[00:09:14] errors, debugging, how software actually
[00:09:16] ships, testing, totally git is where we
[00:09:18] start. Okay,
[00:09:20] >> but first the mission. I don't want to
[00:09:21] guess. Three quick questions. The first
[00:09:23] thing the skill does is it basically
[00:09:26] aligns with what you want to do. I think
[00:09:29] of teaching and learning as not getting
[00:09:33] information into your head but orienting
[00:09:35] you in the world, putting you in a new
[00:09:38] place in the world. And this is kind of
[00:09:40] a bit abstract and a bit you know
[00:09:42] spiritual almost but it's not really I
[00:09:43] mean essentially you need to learn these
[00:09:46] skills in order to do something into the
[00:09:48] in the world and that's your mission
[00:09:50] right so it's like what are you building
[00:09:52] what does ships better software mean to
[00:09:54] you right now what's a concrete project
[00:09:55] you're working on
[00:09:56] >> so let's imagine I answer this let's
[00:09:58] imagine I was a I'm a voice coach
[00:10:00] wanting to learn how to be a better
[00:10:01] coder you know that's actually who I was
[00:10:03] back then so I am a voice teacher and a
[00:10:06] singing teacher I want to build a
[00:10:07] scheduling app to help me schedule my
[00:10:09] students to help me retain notes on my
[00:10:11] students to teach them better and to,
[00:10:14] you know, build something that they can
[00:10:16] help practice with. That's the kind of
[00:10:17] app that I'm looking at. So, probably a
[00:10:20] full stack application with a database
[00:10:22] with some kind of authentication, but
[00:10:24] that's way beyond my abilities right
[00:10:25] now. By the way, I'm using Whisper Flow
[00:10:27] for dictation. It's really good.
[00:10:28] >> Yeah. So, this is going to be also the
[00:10:30] game like how fast you can output your
[00:10:32] tokens from your brain and input them
[00:10:33] back into your brain.
[00:10:35] >> Totally. Yeah. I mean like dictation is
[00:10:38] a if we do a little sidebar on
[00:10:40] dictation, anyone who's not doing
[00:10:42] dictation is just so much faster, right?
[00:10:44] It's very fast for me because I'm like
[00:10:46] quite a fluid speaker. So I can
[00:10:48] translate my brain into words quite
[00:10:51] effectively.
[00:10:52] >> But it's a skill, you know, it's a skill
[00:10:53] at the end of the day and people can can
[00:10:55] uh learn to verbalize false better and
[00:10:57] faster.
[00:10:58] >> Exactly. And it's a skill that is
[00:11:00] actually overpowered if you're if you're
[00:11:02] a developer. It really really is. like
[00:11:04] uh I found that being able to
[00:11:06] communicate and being able to speak was
[00:11:07] something that was just ridiculously
[00:11:09] overpowered in the development world and
[00:11:11] so it has proved um so it has created a
[00:11:14] mission.md here. So, it's basically
[00:11:17] saying, okay, who is this person? What
[00:11:19] do they want to build? Why it matters?
[00:11:20] What success looks like? Being able to
[00:11:22] ship that app, not break it, get it
[00:11:24] live, and trust that it works for real
[00:11:25] students. This is now going to orient
[00:11:28] everything about this skill and what it
[00:11:30] does next. So, you can see it's doing
[00:11:32] some um searches here. So, it's
[00:11:34] searching for some trusted resources.
[00:11:36] How does a full stack web app uh front
[00:11:38] end back end blah blah blah blah blah.
[00:11:40] Let me set up your resources, a learning
[00:11:42] record, a reference cheat sheet, and
[00:11:43] your first lesson. So it's going to
[00:11:45] start churning out some material that's
[00:11:48] running locally. And this is going to
[00:11:51] the idea of this is I think of there are
[00:11:53] skills as stateless skills that don't
[00:11:56] need any state on the local system or
[00:11:58] any kind of like um memory about what
[00:12:01] was done before. And then there are
[00:12:03] stateful skills. So skills that rely on
[00:12:06] information running locally. And this
[00:12:10] teach skill is a stateful skill because
[00:12:12] if you think about working with a great
[00:12:14] teacher, a teacher remembers what you've
[00:12:16] done before. A teacher knows about where
[00:12:18] your sort of
[00:12:20] >> need to go next. Knows what your mission
[00:12:22] is, all that stuff. And so it's saving a
[00:12:24] bunch of states locally so it can
[00:12:26] remember everything. And it's first of
[00:12:28] all created a reference. So we've got a
[00:12:30] reference cheat sheet. It's now going to
[00:12:32] create the first lesson. And these are
[00:12:34] created as HTML. This means we can open
[00:12:36] it in a browser and have like a really
[00:12:38] rich thing to look at because learning
[00:12:40] stuff in the terminal is just brutal.
[00:12:42] >> Yeah. So you're using uh cl code with
[00:12:44] fable, right?
[00:12:45] >> I'm using claw code with opus 4.8 with
[00:12:48] medium effort. So I'm not using fable.
[00:12:50] Not quite yet. I haven't decided whether
[00:12:52] I want to get into fable yet or not. Um
[00:12:55] >> really
[00:12:56] >> I well I mean yeah I I don't I don't
[00:12:59] really believe in all the kind of like
[00:13:02] yesterday was it yesterday when it was
[00:13:03] released. It's just so much unbelievable
[00:13:06] amount of noise. People saying they've
[00:13:07] one-shotted this, oneshotting that. And
[00:13:10] yes, it does seem to be a step change.
[00:13:11] It does seem to be slightly better. But
[00:13:13] then you've got to weigh that against
[00:13:15] the cost of the tokens and how available
[00:13:17] it is, the latency of it. Um I prefer to
[00:13:21] essentially not try a new model when it
[00:13:23] comes out and wait about a month just to
[00:13:25] see how things shake out. That's what I
[00:13:27] did with um Opus 4.5, which was the like
[00:13:30] the last time I really had a massive um
[00:13:34] new feeling about a model and it worked
[00:13:36] fine. You know, you're not you're not
[00:13:37] losing that much by just waiting a
[00:13:39] little while to see how things shake
[00:13:41] out.
[00:13:42] >> All right, so this is the file it
[00:13:43] created.
[00:13:44] >> This is lesson one. Get your projects
[00:13:46] undo button. So we can see that it's
[00:13:48] using a more rich um like actually
[00:13:51] seeing this in the HTML is a lot richer
[00:13:54] and
[00:13:55] >> nicer than doing in the terminal. This
[00:13:57] is saved locally so you can always go
[00:13:58] back and reference this and it's giving
[00:14:01] you actual things you can do in the
[00:14:04] terminal giving you proper exercises to
[00:14:06] go and do it. So you make a folder, go
[00:14:08] into it, start getting it, create a
[00:14:10] file, check the status, stage it, save
[00:14:12] the snapshot, and because of course it's
[00:14:14] running like on my system, it knows what
[00:14:17] my setup is. It's probably already
[00:14:18] checked whether I've got git installed,
[00:14:20] that kind of thing. So it's, you know,
[00:14:22] it's perfectly
[00:14:24] >> personalized education, you know.
[00:14:26] >> Exactly. Totally personalized. So which
[00:14:28] command saves a snapshot of your stage
[00:14:29] changes? David, do you reckon you're
[00:14:31] going to answer this one for me?
[00:14:33] uh get command say snapshot your state
[00:14:36] changes get commit
[00:14:37] >> get commit bam so again it's using
[00:14:41] techniques that are well known in
[00:14:42] education for increasing um storage
[00:14:45] strength right so quizzes are such an
[00:14:48] awkward thing like I sort of hate
[00:14:50] quizzes but quizzes are just
[00:14:52] unreasonably effective for uh increasing
[00:14:55] the strength that something is stored in
[00:14:58] uh what command shows what has changed
[00:14:59] right now David
[00:15:01] >> good status
[00:15:02] Get status. Yeah. Oh, bugger. I pressed
[00:15:05] the wrong thing.
[00:15:07] Uh, what does git add do to a change?
[00:15:09] >> Stages changes.
[00:15:11] >> Stage changes. A commit is best pictured
[00:15:13] as a
[00:15:16] >> safe point.
[00:15:17] >> Safe point. You broke a file but haven't
[00:15:19] committed. To restore it, you run
[00:15:22] >> um get restore.
[00:15:25] >> Yeah, I think it's git restore, isn't
[00:15:27] it? Yes, there it is. Very good.
[00:15:29] >> Okay.
[00:15:30] And so it then sends you off to read a
[00:15:32] primary source if you fancy it. So the
[00:15:34] um progit book
[00:15:36] >> um and then invites you to ask your
[00:15:39] teacher follow-up questions and create
[00:15:40] the next lesson. And so the idea of this
[00:15:43] is you I think of knowledge as like a
[00:15:45] graph, right? It's like a big forest
[00:15:47] through which you're exploring. And what
[00:15:49] this is doing is it's creating a linear
[00:15:51] path through that graph. It's basically
[00:15:53] going okay, you've learned this. Now
[00:15:55] that's I I know that you've learned it.
[00:15:57] It's in your learning record. We can see
[00:15:59] it's retaining a list of learning
[00:16:00] records in the top right here, which is
[00:16:03] your mission and your starting point.
[00:16:05] So, it's captured your mission, a
[00:16:07] decision to start with Git zone of
[00:16:09] approximal development, current
[00:16:10] estimates, you get the idea. So, it's
[00:16:14] great. I freaking love it. And that's
[00:16:16] what I would recommend to anyone
[00:16:17] starting with uh especially development
[00:16:21] because it's sort of I mean, I'm a
[00:16:22] developer. I know what developer
[00:16:24] education is. And so I've sort of put
[00:16:26] that into this teach skill. And I think
[00:16:29] I've always thought coding was quite
[00:16:30] easy to learn. Like I didn't have that
[00:16:32] much trouble when I was learning it
[00:16:34] myself. And
[00:16:36] I I think this is a great way to do it.
[00:16:39] >> So is this live on GitHub somewhere?
[00:16:40] Where can people find this?
[00:16:42] >> GitHub Matt Pokco skills. And if you
[00:16:45] head there, you just run this uh CLI
[00:16:49] command npx skills latest add map
[00:16:52] skills. You can choose the teach skill
[00:16:54] and it will just save to your local
[00:16:56] setup. So whether you're using claw
[00:16:58] code, whether you're using codeex, it
[00:17:00] will work and you'll be able to then
[00:17:01] just invoke teach inside a fresh
[00:17:03] workspace.
[00:17:04] >> So you have, you know, perhaps the most
[00:17:06] at least one of the most famous and
[00:17:08] popular skills repos. What separates a
[00:17:11] good agent skill from a bad one?
[00:17:14] >> It's such a deep question.
[00:17:17] It's such a deep question because it
[00:17:18] depends what you want. Um you can think
[00:17:21] of there as being two types of skills.
[00:17:24] There are skills that are procedures,
[00:17:27] skills that you intend to uh run
[00:17:29] yourself and then there are skills that
[00:17:32] are more like abilities. Those are abil
[00:17:35] like things that you intend the model to
[00:17:38] invoke itself. And so a good ability for
[00:17:41] instance might be uh your coding
[00:17:44] standards let's say. So let's say your
[00:17:46] agent is sort of doing its own thing
[00:17:48] kind of working along and it needs to
[00:17:49] check uh how you like your react code
[00:17:52] written. So it's going to write some
[00:17:53] React code you it pulls in the ability
[00:17:56] uh great React coding standards let's
[00:17:58] say and then it reads it and it
[00:18:00] understands okay I shouldn't use use
[00:18:01] effect I should use something different
[00:18:04] a procedure is more like something uh
[00:18:07] this is how I prefer my skills written
[00:18:09] it's something that you invoke yourself
[00:18:12] to get the model to behave a certain way
[00:18:14] it's something I love is my grill me
[00:18:18] skill that's one of my most popular
[00:18:19] skills what it essentially does It turns
[00:18:22] the model into an adversarial
[00:18:24] interviewer. So this is under
[00:18:26] productivity under grill me. It's
[00:18:28] incredibly short and you can see it's
[00:18:31] literally just uh four sentences I think
[00:18:34] this skill maybe five sentences and it's
[00:18:36] unreasonably effective because it just
[00:18:38] turns the agent into an adversarial
[00:18:41] interviewer asking you questions
[00:18:43] interviewing you and popping up with
[00:18:45] ideas that you might not have considered
[00:18:47] until you reach a shared understanding.
[00:18:49] I've been using this for coding first of
[00:18:52] all just like as a replacement for plan
[00:18:54] mode. So before you actually go and
[00:18:56] implement some code, you go, okay,
[00:18:58] here's my idea. Uh, interview me about
[00:19:00] it. Let's reach a shared understanding.
[00:19:01] Let's flush out any weirdness or any
[00:19:04] unexpected stuff before we get in as
[00:19:06] much as you can. And it's just
[00:19:09] unreasonably effective. And this is a
[00:19:11] procedure. This is not an ability.
[00:19:13] >> I tend to prefer my skills as
[00:19:15] procedures. I like to be the one in
[00:19:17] control. I like to go, okay, we'll do
[00:19:19] grill me and then we'll go, let's write
[00:19:22] a product requirements document. So we
[00:19:24] use two PRD for instance. Then let's
[00:19:26] take that PRD and turn it into
[00:19:28] individual issues so that we can work
[00:19:30] through them. That's just personally how
[00:19:33] I like to do it. But other skills such
[00:19:34] as superpowers from Opera, which is
[00:19:36] probably the most popular skills repo
[00:19:38] out there, it takes the opposite
[00:19:40] approach and it prefers things to be
[00:19:41] more like the model is in control. But
[00:19:44] I've always preferred to me personally
[00:19:46] be in control because I know my skills,
[00:19:48] I know my abilities. I don't want to
[00:19:49] delegate my thinking to the model.
[00:19:51] >> Yeah. I mean that I think is one of the
[00:19:54] See, I'm like playing with this idea of
[00:19:56] the list. It's like a list of
[00:19:59] abilities, you know, knowledge.
[00:20:02] Basically something that like if you
[00:20:04] could take the average, you know, 100x
[00:20:07] developer that uses AI versus a, you
[00:20:10] know, 1x developer, whatever. What would
[00:20:12] be the list of the differences, right?
[00:20:14] You can say like okay some of these are
[00:20:15] like raw intelligence you know blah blah
[00:20:18] blah but most of them are probably
[00:20:20] teachable most of them are some skills
[00:20:21] some knowledge something like that so
[00:20:23] I'm obsessed with this idea and I think
[00:20:25] one of them is kind of knowing when to
[00:20:28] have the AI ask you right like kind of
[00:20:30] this grill me style of skill because
[00:20:32] personally I found out like the biggest
[00:20:34] difference instead of like saying
[00:20:35] oneshot this app I describe my vision
[00:20:37] for this app and say like list out the
[00:20:40] 10 most consequential decisions right
[00:20:42] the software design decisions
[00:20:43] architectural decisions
[00:20:44] product decisions that will shape this
[00:20:47] project and ask interview me until you
[00:20:50] understand 98% about it. Right? So, kind
[00:20:52] of that is like one of the things I
[00:20:54] would put on the list. What what are
[00:20:56] some of the things you think are on the
[00:20:58] list?
[00:21:00] >> Well, can we um can I challenge the idea
[00:21:03] that this is possible? Is it right if I
[00:21:06] take this question in a different way?
[00:21:08] Because
[00:21:10] >> skills are really hard to write uh
[00:21:13] especially because every single skill
[00:21:15] that you write it leaks a description
[00:21:18] this description here into the context
[00:21:20] window. Right.
[00:21:21] >> Yeah.
[00:21:22] >> And you can disable this. So you can uh
[00:21:24] there are some skills in here I think in
[00:21:26] my engineering zoom out I think which
[00:21:29] has uh disable model invocation true. So
[00:21:32] this one uh this skill can only be
[00:21:35] invoked by the user and this means its
[00:21:37] description is not leaked into context.
[00:21:41] Every single ability uh let's say we
[00:21:44] have the list. Let's say we have a 100
[00:21:45] different skills. You're going to be
[00:21:47] leaking 100 descriptions into the
[00:21:49] context window. Right?
[00:21:51] >> Okay. Maybe let me rephrase. I didn't
[00:21:52] mean it for the AI. I meant the list is
[00:21:55] the person, right? Like if you had to
[00:21:58] say like I know it's difficult to like
[00:22:01] it's maybe a reductionist to take
[00:22:03] someone who's like really insanely
[00:22:05] productive you know maybe like so some
[00:22:06] of the top people at opening are onic
[00:22:08] who like worth hundreds of typical
[00:22:10] developers right what would be the list
[00:22:14] of their abilities skills knowledge that
[00:22:17] compare them to an average developer
[00:22:19] >> yeah got you well this I mean the you're
[00:22:22] kind of heading in my direction I think
[00:22:24] which is I prefer to hide most of these
[00:22:27] descriptions from the AI itself and keep
[00:22:31] all of that knowledge inside the human,
[00:22:33] right, inside the developer. And so I
[00:22:36] prefer that's how I prefer my skills to
[00:22:37] be used is you essentially are the
[00:22:39] driver. You know, you take the steering
[00:22:41] wheel. And so I do think that this is
[00:22:46] such an exciting time to be a senior dev
[00:22:50] and to like be able to share and like
[00:22:54] procedurize proceduralize maybe um your
[00:22:58] work into reusable chunks, right? Like
[00:23:02] in in a codebase you have a function
[00:23:03] that's repeated three times. you take
[00:23:06] that function and you pull it out into a
[00:23:08] shared function that is then you know um
[00:23:11] you reduce the duplication basically and
[00:23:13] we're able to do that now with our own
[00:23:16] procedures with how we build software
[00:23:18] we're able to take these like okay I've
[00:23:21] uh you know made this plan a h 100 times
[00:23:23] I know how to make good plans I can turn
[00:23:25] that into a skill distribute that to my
[00:23:27] team and everyone can be planning in the
[00:23:29] same way contributing back to that same
[00:23:30] skill making everyone on the team better
[00:23:33] so you're raising the floor really on
[00:23:35] what engineers can do. It's such an
[00:23:37] exciting time. And what I would say
[00:23:40] though is that skills like
[00:23:44] there's like know I'm going to sort of
[00:23:47] confuse our terminology a bit. I think
[00:23:48] of there as being three things that you
[00:23:50] need to be good at anything which is you
[00:23:52] need knowledge. You need the fundamental
[00:23:54] sort of uh what is that thing like
[00:23:56] understanding it in your head. You need
[00:23:58] the skills. You need to be able to have
[00:24:00] done it a bunch of times to like um you
[00:24:02] know in muscle memory. And then you need
[00:24:04] wisdom. You need to know when to do it.
[00:24:07] You need to know how it fits in in the
[00:24:10] real world. And wisdom is almost
[00:24:14] impossible to obtain without actually
[00:24:16] having done the thing in the exact
[00:24:18] context where you need to do it. So if
[00:24:21] you want to be like someone at
[00:24:23] anthropic, sure you can gain the
[00:24:25] knowledge, you can gain the skills, but
[00:24:26] then how are you going to gain the
[00:24:27] wisdom, right? Like you need to probably
[00:24:29] go to anthropic to gain the wisdom to
[00:24:31] actually understand how to do the thing,
[00:24:32] you know? But I think it's like being
[00:24:35] able to bundle the first two knowledge
[00:24:36] and skills into something that's
[00:24:38] reusable is such a fascinating
[00:24:41] um outcome of this weird age we're
[00:24:44] living in.
[00:24:46] >> So currently we talked about skills.
[00:24:49] What's your agentic engineering setup?
[00:24:51] Like what tools do you use? What models?
[00:24:54] How many agents?
[00:24:56] >> Yeah. Um so my setup is um I use claude
[00:25:00] code essentially for planning and for um
[00:25:04] some implementation locally. So I'm
[00:25:06] using Opus 4.8 with um medium effort is
[00:25:09] kind of what I've landed on and it works
[00:25:11] fine. I do most of my uh development and
[00:25:14] a lot of my work now um AFK so with me
[00:25:18] away from the keyboard and the way I do
[00:25:21] that is with something I built which is
[00:25:24] uh a tool called sand castle and sand
[00:25:26] castle is essentially a way to run
[00:25:29] agents inside sandboxes.
[00:25:31] >> Okay,
[00:25:31] >> so you can um inside like if you don't
[00:25:35] run an agent in a sandbox then it's
[00:25:37] going to do weird stuff. So it might you
[00:25:40] know randomly delete your home directory
[00:25:41] or um you know exfiltrate your um
[00:25:44] environment variables out to um bad
[00:25:47] sites etc. With Sand Castle, you're
[00:25:50] essentially able to plug in things like
[00:25:52] Docker or Podman and run agents, run
[00:25:55] either uh this is what it looks like,
[00:25:57] run clawed code uh inside some sandbox,
[00:26:00] which is extremely cool, extremely
[00:26:02] effective and it means that you can
[00:26:04] parallelize a bunch of agents at once
[00:26:06] either on your own machine or you can
[00:26:08] use like Versel sandboxes for instance
[00:26:11] to just ping up a remote agent and then
[00:26:14] pull the commits back into your local
[00:26:16] workspace.
[00:26:18] I've been doing that and I've been
[00:26:19] combining it actually with GitHub
[00:26:21] actions. So we can see inside for
[00:26:23] instance here inside the actions tab of
[00:26:25] map sand castle this one this was an
[00:26:29] agent review action which happened a
[00:26:32] little while ago which checks out the
[00:26:35] branch. This runs on on a PR. It uh runs
[00:26:39] the review agent which is just a prompt
[00:26:41] I have locally. We can see all of the um
[00:26:43] things the agent did. It's checking
[00:26:45] various things blah blah blah blah blah
[00:26:47] uh type check round clean and then it
[00:26:49] replies saying cool it all looks good to
[00:26:52] me. So that's mostly how I've been doing
[00:26:55] things is running uh agents using sand
[00:26:59] castle on GitHub actions and essentially
[00:27:02] just telling them to do things and that
[00:27:05] has been extremely unreasonably
[00:27:06] effective because you just get to
[00:27:08] parallelize as much as you want. you're
[00:27:09] not worried about constraining the
[00:27:11] resources on your local machine and yeah
[00:27:14] it's just very very quick to just spin
[00:27:16] up an agent and get it to do something.
[00:27:19] >> So in terms of models are these 5.5
[00:27:21] extra high are these another cloth codes
[00:27:23] what do you prefer?
[00:27:24] >> These are I think uh again just claw
[00:27:28] code uh opus 4.8 eight medium. I think I
[00:27:31] don't think I've varied it too much to
[00:27:33] be honest. I mostly don't worry about
[00:27:35] models that much. I mostly just use
[00:27:38] >> um like I think
[00:27:41] yeah, this is my sort of hot take I
[00:27:43] suppose which is that
[00:27:45] >> everyone is obsessed with the model.
[00:27:47] Everyone's obsessed with the engine of
[00:27:50] the Formula 1 car whereas in fact the
[00:27:52] engine is really only a part of the
[00:27:55] whole system. Right? You've got the
[00:27:57] entire chassis. You've got uh how it um
[00:28:00] how it moves through the air. Everyone's
[00:28:03] obsessed with the uh model and I think
[00:28:06] they should be more interested in the
[00:28:07] harness, what you can do to get the most
[00:28:09] out of the harness. Uh giving it the
[00:28:11] right prompts, giving it the right
[00:28:12] skills to work with and improving the
[00:28:14] environment in which the model runs,
[00:28:16] improving the codebase and all that
[00:28:18] stuff. So yeah, as I sort of said with
[00:28:21] Fable, like I the model is useful, but I
[00:28:25] think the harness has an equal amount of
[00:28:27] work and you have much more control of
[00:28:29] the harness than you do the model.
[00:28:31] >> That's true. I would maybe challenge you
[00:28:33] a bit on this because I don't see why
[00:28:35] you cannot do both because like
[00:28:37] obviously I I agree that you need the
[00:28:39] right skills, you need the right setup,
[00:28:41] all of that matters, but then if you
[00:28:43] swap in a better engine, all of that is
[00:28:45] instantly better. No.
[00:28:47] >> Yeah, it totally is. Um but I think they
[00:28:50] you need to think of them as 50/50 right
[00:28:53] so instead of um the model being like
[00:28:55] 90% and sort of the 10% optimization of
[00:28:57] har like everyone's so focused on the
[00:28:59] model people are not so like intrigued
[00:29:03] by
[00:29:05] so okay let's go back one step there's a
[00:29:08] famous idea in ML which is the bitter
[00:29:11] lesson you heard of the bitter lesson
[00:29:12] >> yes
[00:29:14] >> yes the bitter lesson is the idea that
[00:29:17] Um, whatever you do in machine learning
[00:29:20] research, compute, raw compute will just
[00:29:23] beat you every time because compute is
[00:29:25] increasing at such a high rate that you
[00:29:27] can just essentially trust that the
[00:29:29] underlying thing will get better and
[00:29:31] that will uh beat any optimizations you
[00:29:34] put on top of it. And there's a a sort
[00:29:36] of idea here that maybe I'm falling into
[00:29:38] the bitter lesson that instead of like
[00:29:40] like optimizing my setup, optimizing my
[00:29:43] harness, I should just wait for the
[00:29:44] models to get better, wait for the
[00:29:45] engine to get better, and then my car
[00:29:47] will be faster.
[00:29:49] I don't know. I still think there's a
[00:29:51] lot to be gained by just optimizing the
[00:29:53] harness and focusing on creating like
[00:29:56] good code bases that the agent can do
[00:29:58] well in instead of hamstringing the
[00:30:00] agent before it even gets started. I
[00:30:02] would say probably I I I agree that you
[00:30:05] shouldn't wait. Like that's that's that
[00:30:06] was a very stupid idea. People just
[00:30:08] waiting around for AGI or not doing
[00:30:10] anything. Obviously, I completely agree
[00:30:11] with you there. I would say I'm
[00:30:13] somewhere in the middle. I would say
[00:30:14] like I'm actively trying to improve my
[00:30:16] setup every single day trying to, you
[00:30:18] know, get faster at using these agents.
[00:30:21] Figure out, okay, should I be using Cmax
[00:30:23] here? Should I be using should I put
[00:30:24] this on VPS? Should I be using Tailscale
[00:30:26] here? trying to like actively improve
[00:30:29] everything else except for the model but
[00:30:31] also trying to use the best model
[00:30:33] possible because fundamentally like you
[00:30:35] said you might be falling into that. I
[00:30:37] would say maybe if it's 50/50 now for
[00:30:39] the simplicity of this argument, what if
[00:30:41] like the model really becomes a lot
[00:30:43] better, right? Like let's let's assume
[00:30:45] the next generation, right? Like Opus 6,
[00:30:47] Fable 6, GPD 6, whatever 7 like don't
[00:30:52] you think these models will require less
[00:30:54] steering and like less handholding as
[00:30:57] they become more competent or or no?
[00:31:01] >> I'm not a pundit, right? This is what I
[00:31:03] say to every single one of these
[00:31:04] questions. I'm trying to do the best
[00:31:06] with what I have right now and I don't I
[00:31:10] don't have the insight to know whether
[00:31:12] these things will get better. I don't
[00:31:14] really want to make predictions about
[00:31:15] the future. I think that if I try to
[00:31:18] keep my um workspace and my harness
[00:31:23] agent agnostic as much as possible, if I
[00:31:25] try to apply good software fundamentals
[00:31:27] to what I'm doing, if I do stuff that's
[00:31:30] always worked, then it will probably
[00:31:32] continue to work in the future. You know
[00:31:34] what I mean?
[00:31:35] >> So, if I try to overoptimize around a
[00:31:37] model, if I get too focused on the
[00:31:39] model, I will lose focus on um the
[00:31:42] fundamentals. That's that's that's my
[00:31:44] point of view.
[00:31:45] >> Yeah. So basically you're focused on
[00:31:46] like okay what has been true for the
[00:31:47] last 10 20 30 years you know the the the
[00:31:50] really best principles of great software
[00:31:54] and it's likely going to hold up with
[00:31:56] the next model rather than people going
[00:31:57] from the model first and like okay this
[00:31:59] model maybe requires shorter prompts
[00:32:01] this model you know sucks at that part
[00:32:02] let me patch that part like building up
[00:32:05] you know properly proper foundation
[00:32:07] rather than like starting with the model
[00:32:09] maybe
[00:32:10] >> exactly people are focused on the wrong
[00:32:11] thing they're looking at the big shiny
[00:32:14] new when in fact just focus on the stuff
[00:32:17] that's been working for 30 40 years, you
[00:32:19] know, and it really does work, you know,
[00:32:22] if you have a codebase that's easy to
[00:32:23] change. Like people like people ask me
[00:32:26] all the time like how do you optimize
[00:32:28] for for token spend, right? How do you
[00:32:30] optimize for token spend? Have a code
[00:32:32] base that's easier to make changes in?
[00:32:34] Because then you can employ a stupider
[00:32:35] model. If your codebase architecture is
[00:32:37] better, then you can get a cheaper model
[00:32:41] to do the same work because it your
[00:32:43] guard rails are better, it's easier to
[00:32:46] explore, it needs to spend fewer tokens
[00:32:48] banging its head against the wall. If
[00:32:50] you're hamstringing your model from day
[00:32:51] one, then you will need a smart model to
[00:32:54] get the most out of it. Um, but yeah, so
[00:32:57] I think thinking from the model first is
[00:32:59] the wrong way to do it.
[00:33:01] >> Yeah. So basically I would say like the
[00:33:02] exact opposite of you is like the
[00:33:04] quintessential vibe coder who like is
[00:33:07] switching tools every single week right
[00:33:09] like there's a new replet update goes to
[00:33:11] replet agent switches to lovable
[00:33:13] switches to this and that constantly
[00:33:14] switching and never learning any any
[00:33:17] programming principles anything about
[00:33:18] software engineering nothing you're like
[00:33:20] your approach is basically the
[00:33:22] difference is in approach it's not like
[00:33:23] you don't believe in AI obviously right
[00:33:25] now you you're heavily trying to be at
[00:33:28] the age of AI and educating people how
[00:33:30] to use it it's more about the difference
[00:33:31] of approach. She's like, "Listen guys,
[00:33:33] learn the fundamentals. Learn how code
[00:33:35] works, how good software looks like, and
[00:33:38] this is going to be valuable no matter
[00:33:39] what. No matter if OpenAI is ahead,
[00:33:41] Enthropic is ahead, Gemini is ahead."
[00:33:43] Versus the exact opposite approach,
[00:33:45] which unfortunately I think most of the
[00:33:47] people who are new to AI take is like
[00:33:49] jumping on the latest trend and like
[00:33:50] switching everything the moment, you
[00:33:52] know, some new update or tool comes out.
[00:33:55] >> Totally. And I think, you know, that's,
[00:33:57] you know, you can do that and that's
[00:33:58] exciting. Um, but you're not really
[00:34:01] increasing your skills that way. And
[00:34:03] it's your skills. I firmly believe that
[00:34:05] are the ceiling to what AI can do. You
[00:34:08] should be focused on yourself. You know,
[00:34:09] upskilling yourself for this new world
[00:34:12] instead of thinking um, right? How do I
[00:34:14] delegate my thinking? How do I delegate
[00:34:17] more? You know, you should be pulling
[00:34:19] more into your own domain and delegating
[00:34:21] only the tactical stuff. Keep the
[00:34:23] strategic mindset. keep thinking about
[00:34:26] you know the next uh months and weeks
[00:34:28] ahead the road map of where you're going
[00:34:29] in your code instead of just um trying
[00:34:32] to delegate that to you know people are
[00:34:34] obsessed by the idea that you know you
[00:34:36] can just delegate everything to AI and
[00:34:37] you can't you really can't and I don't
[00:34:40] see I mean again I'm not a pundit you
[00:34:42] know I'm just looking at what we have
[00:34:44] right now and it doesn't
[00:34:47] >> yeah yeah I I am the person in the real
[00:34:49] world that's driving this stuff I need
[00:34:51] to be the one making product decisions I
[00:34:53] know where I'm going And I think me as a
[00:34:57] developer, I should be in control and I
[00:34:58] need the skills to be able to do that.
[00:35:00] >> I agree. One note I'm going to share on
[00:35:03] Fable is that happened yesterday which
[00:35:05] is a bit scary and it definitely doesn't
[00:35:07] follow security practices is that I was
[00:35:10] setting up a new um like a new agent for
[00:35:12] for like Twitter and basically u the
[00:35:14] Twitter API was bugged. The developer
[00:35:16] console was wasn't loading some buttons
[00:35:18] and I tried it on a different browser.
[00:35:19] It still didn't work. I disabled all
[00:35:21] extensions. It still didn't work. So I
[00:35:22] gave it like a few solid minutes to try
[00:35:24] to debug it and I failed. I mean I
[00:35:26] didn't it wasn't the main thing I needed
[00:35:27] to get done so I didn't really try as
[00:35:29] hard as I could but I gave it to Cursor
[00:35:32] powered by Fable. It used the built-in
[00:35:35] browser inside of cursor. You know I had
[00:35:38] to log in obviously to the console but
[00:35:40] apart from that it started clicking. It
[00:35:42] created API keys copied them. Again I do
[00:35:44] not recommend this for production apps.
[00:35:46] This is just a simple thing for me. And
[00:35:49] then it figured out when it did the
[00:35:50] testing that those API keys were in a
[00:35:52] different like app in the console and
[00:35:55] they actually weren't using the credits
[00:35:57] I charged up. So then it moved the app
[00:35:59] again using the built-in browser inside
[00:36:00] of cursor and like for me I really felt
[00:36:03] like what am I doing here? Like
[00:36:04] obviously I described what we're
[00:36:06] building, why are we building it, some
[00:36:07] of the you know kind of my version of
[00:36:09] grill me at the start but then I felt
[00:36:11] like okay I just logged in into the
[00:36:14] console and I just charge up a few
[00:36:16] dollars but like everything else the AI
[00:36:18] was doing right so like I felt like my
[00:36:20] value in this project was a lot lower
[00:36:22] than with previous models.
[00:36:25] So what's your thoughts on this?
[00:36:28] I mean, if you think about the AI's
[00:36:30] output, right, what it what it was doing
[00:36:32] at the end there, um, it needed like how
[00:36:37] does the AI know at the end that it's
[00:36:39] done a good job, right? What it is is
[00:36:41] the theory here that you can disappear
[00:36:43] from the project completely. No, you're
[00:36:45] still needed, right? Like all we're
[00:36:46] doing here is we've just given the AI a
[00:36:49] set of tools and we're it's, you know,
[00:36:51] we've given it a scoped task and it's
[00:36:53] performing that task, right? you know it
[00:36:55] we've given it a goal and we said you
[00:36:56] know do blah blah blah blah blah I don't
[00:36:58] think of that as that particularly
[00:36:59] magical you know that's something that
[00:37:01] uh agents can do now you just give them
[00:37:03] the tools and they go and do it but to
[00:37:06] decide whether that's the right thing to
[00:37:08] do to um uh security test that at the
[00:37:10] end of that that's something that you're
[00:37:12] needed for right you David are needed
[00:37:15] for that to know whether it's done a
[00:37:16] good job and so yeah we can delegate
[00:37:18] more but I don't think that's a reason
[00:37:20] to start thinking um you know or have AI
[00:37:24] psychosis or anything. It's just yeah,
[00:37:26] it's a reasonable thing that the AI can
[00:37:27] do with computer use.
[00:37:29] >> I've also seen a lot of people report
[00:37:32] like they they were, you know, maybe
[00:37:34] looking for optimizations or doing some
[00:37:36] feature and then again I'm talking about
[00:37:39] fable because it just came out. It's
[00:37:40] topical, right? So, it's on top of my
[00:37:41] mind. But a lot of people reported that
[00:37:43] it found like deeper bugs that they
[00:37:45] didn't notice at all. Whereas other
[00:37:47] models completely miss those. And that I
[00:37:50] I I would like again I would challenge
[00:37:51] you slightly that that's a sign of like
[00:37:53] AI being able to do more. I'm not saying
[00:37:55] we need to be completely removed from
[00:37:57] the loop but like if the AI is you know
[00:37:59] redesigning the front end and it finds a
[00:38:02] issue in one of the like backend API
[00:38:04] endpoints like a major security issue I
[00:38:07] would argue that that's like AI being
[00:38:09] more involved.
[00:38:11] It's not a 50/50 at that point.
[00:38:14] >> Yeah. So you're saying that um
[00:38:18] the better a the better the engine is
[00:38:19] the more value you can bring to the
[00:38:21] business just by having the engine and
[00:38:23] those effects are emergent. You don't
[00:38:25] know what you're going to get by
[00:38:26] increasing the power of
[00:38:28] >> it. It will still know the vision,
[00:38:29] right? It will still know what you're
[00:38:30] doing here. Like this is a educational
[00:38:32] repository for my students in my paid
[00:38:34] community or this is something just for
[00:38:36] my team. It will be used by roughly five
[00:38:38] people. The purpose of this is XY Z. It
[00:38:40] will still know the core idea, the
[00:38:42] initiative that comes from you. But in
[00:38:44] terms of the actions and like what
[00:38:47] happens, my argument would be that as
[00:38:49] the models get more powerful, more and
[00:38:50] more of these is going to be done by the
[00:38:52] AI. But not only that, the AI will spot
[00:38:54] what needs to be done, such as the
[00:38:56] example with the, you know, deep bugs
[00:38:58] that the user wasn't even debugging.
[00:39:00] >> Totally. But I I think that we think
[00:39:03] that the model is the only way to get
[00:39:04] there, right? What you could be doing is
[00:39:06] in your repository is you could run an a
[00:39:10] cron job that runs every single day,
[00:39:12] let's say, and does a security review
[00:39:14] and every day it checks a new part of
[00:39:15] the repo, right? And you could use a
[00:39:17] relatively simple model for that and you
[00:39:18] probably get some decent results. I mean
[00:39:20] this idea that there are deep bugs that
[00:39:22] um you know or deep sort of security
[00:39:25] things inside your application that uh
[00:39:28] the model could spot and others cannot
[00:39:30] you know like sure that's like it sounds
[00:39:33] attractive but you could probably also
[00:39:35] uncover those bugs with cheaper models
[00:39:37] if you just looked in the right places
[00:39:39] you know and you gave it the right
[00:39:41] prompt let's say for one of a better
[00:39:42] word or the right harness so I don't
[00:39:44] think there's something that's
[00:39:46] necessarily special about the model that
[00:39:48] does those things or you know and I
[00:39:50] think that's again 50/50. If you had a
[00:39:53] harness that sort of was looking
[00:39:54] specifically for those things then you
[00:39:56] would find them and I think we're
[00:39:58] lagging behind in our practices and
[00:40:00] expecting the model to just pick up the
[00:40:02] slack.
[00:40:02] >> You can absolutely just run Opus and get
[00:40:06] it to do that stuff. You know, people
[00:40:07] were talking about this like when Opus
[00:40:09] 4.5 came out, whoa, all these security
[00:40:11] things that Opus, it's just like, sure,
[00:40:14] it's found them and you can just get
[00:40:16] that with a harness and just get it to
[00:40:17] do it again and again. I like
[00:40:20] >> Yeah, I I understand. I understand like
[00:40:22] you're basically pushing against the
[00:40:24] hype wave, you know, you're trying to
[00:40:25] like implement some sense, some wisdom
[00:40:28] into this. Say like guys, okay, the
[00:40:30] models are getting better. Yes. But at
[00:40:31] the same time, let's not lose the
[00:40:33] obvious, you know, optimizations, the
[00:40:36] obvious things that has always always
[00:40:37] been true. Maybe like if you had a
[00:40:39] better harness, you could support it
[00:40:40] even in the previous generation model.
[00:40:42] Or maybe you didn't have to spend $2,000
[00:40:44] on API tokens, maybe only 200, you know,
[00:40:46] stuff like that. So yeah, I I completely
[00:40:48] agree with you there. You're trying to
[00:40:49] be like
[00:40:50] >> one thing one thing just to to finish
[00:40:52] there, which is that
[00:40:54] >> what is this what is this thing that
[00:40:55] you've learned from Fable looking at
[00:40:57] your code and spotting a security issue?
[00:40:59] What you've actually learned? Sure,
[00:41:01] you've learned that Fable is good
[00:41:02] definitely, but you've also learned that
[00:41:04] there are security issues in your code,
[00:41:06] right? And you should probably have
[00:41:08] something that runs and checks for more
[00:41:10] security issues in the future. We need
[00:41:12] to build loops into our um loops for
[00:41:15] God's sake um into our I mean, we can
[00:41:18] talk about that as well if I've got some
[00:41:19] opinions there. Um, you need to build
[00:41:22] these uh systems that just check your
[00:41:26] like you need, what am I trying to say?
[00:41:30] >> You need to figure out why it happened
[00:41:32] like why it even got to this place. You
[00:41:33] know, it's like if someone keeps
[00:41:34] stealing your bike, maybe buy a lock.
[00:41:38] >> Yes, exactly. Maybe we need to uh be
[00:41:41] designing systems that are
[00:41:44] self-improving over time, right? And
[00:41:46] this is something that we've been doing
[00:41:48] as software engineers for a long time.
[00:41:50] We write test suites so that we can test
[00:41:52] our own code. We do human reviews so
[00:41:54] that we can make sure things are looking
[00:41:56] the way they need to. We refactor so
[00:41:58] that we can change code better in the
[00:41:59] future. And sure, a model has uncovered
[00:42:02] that we need to do a bit more of that.
[00:42:04] So let's do a bit more of it. But we
[00:42:05] don't need to use the fancy model in
[00:42:07] order to get those insights. See, that's
[00:42:09] what one of the things I would put on
[00:42:10] the list is like the thing that really
[00:42:12] separates the people who are going to go
[00:42:14] super fast with the AI and build better
[00:42:17] and more software versus people who are
[00:42:19] not. Like most people in that situation,
[00:42:20] they would just say, "Oh yeah, Fable is
[00:42:22] great. Fix the bug. It fixes the bug."
[00:42:24] But like the the people I don't know if
[00:42:26] it's like 10x developer, it's almost
[00:42:28] like 10x AI builder, you know, because
[00:42:31] everybody's becoming more of a builder,
[00:42:33] whether it's a designer background, a
[00:42:34] developer background. It's like that
[00:42:35] person would look at the underlying
[00:42:37] issues. is like how did that even
[00:42:38] happen? How did I have this bug for so
[00:42:40] long that I didn't notice it and try to
[00:42:42] patch the underlying issue? You know,
[00:42:44] whether it's a new skill, a new system,
[00:42:45] better staging process, whatever that I
[00:42:48] think I would put as one of the things
[00:42:50] on the list of your human capabilities
[00:42:53] or things you should have to get the
[00:42:55] most out of AI. Totally agree.
[00:42:58] >> All right. So, you mentioned loops. This
[00:43:00] was super viral on Twitter. Maybe it
[00:43:02] still is, but like, you know, a week
[00:43:03] ago. Um I think it started with Peter
[00:43:05] Stanberger if I'm not mistaken. But
[00:43:07] basically people are like obsessing over
[00:43:08] agentic loops. Uh half of it I would say
[00:43:10] is like the research labs selling more
[00:43:12] tokens. You know basically you should be
[00:43:14] running loops to pay us more endless
[00:43:17] tokens. Stop prompting your agents.
[00:43:19] Figure out what loops it can run forever
[00:43:20] permanently. Half of it could be useful.
[00:43:23] What's your thoughts?
[00:43:25] >> So
[00:43:26] what we're essentially talking about
[00:43:28] here is the difference between human in
[00:43:29] the loop work and AFK work. Right. human
[00:43:32] in the loop work being the human you are
[00:43:35] there with the agent um talking together
[00:43:37] and like uh figuring out something. So
[00:43:40] really useful for planning, really
[00:43:41] useful for some kind of more complicated
[00:43:43] implementations, uh really useful for
[00:43:45] unscoped work, you know, stuff that you
[00:43:47] just need to uh figure it out locally
[00:43:49] with the agent. And then we're talking
[00:43:51] about AFK stuff. So AFK away from
[00:43:54] keyboard, you ping off the agent and it
[00:43:56] goes and does something. Now,
[00:43:59] I think that I mean the moment that I
[00:44:01] discovered AFK was the moment I really
[00:44:04] got into AI coding and the moment I was
[00:44:06] really able to massively increase my
[00:44:08] output because then instead of me having
[00:44:11] to sit in the loop, handle all the
[00:44:13] permissions requests, handle all of the,
[00:44:15] you know, anything the agent needs to
[00:44:16] ask me. The moment I can just remove
[00:44:18] myself from the equation, I've paralyzed
[00:44:20] myself. Suddenly there are two of me,
[00:44:22] you know, or three of me, four of me,
[00:44:23] five of me able to go and produce so
[00:44:25] much more code that I then go and
[00:44:27] review. This idea that loops are the
[00:44:29] only way to do it is crazy, you know,
[00:44:31] like we're essentially talking about the
[00:44:34] history of this goes back to Jeffrey
[00:44:35] Huntley. Uh where is it? G Huntley Ralph
[00:44:39] uh goes back to Ralph. You remember
[00:44:41] Ralph?
[00:44:42] >> Yeah,
[00:44:42] >> I was talking about Ralph in uh January,
[00:44:44] I think. Um the original article comes
[00:44:46] from 14th of July last year. And
[00:44:49] essentially it's a loop. So this is the
[00:44:52] idea where you have a while loop that
[00:44:54] says okay pass this prompt to claude
[00:44:56] code and then um eventually you'll be
[00:44:59] done. Now it's essentially just uh
[00:45:04] running clawed code again and again and
[00:45:06] again. That's the idea of the Ralph loop
[00:45:08] that I was talking about for a while.
[00:45:10] And what I realized is I don't really
[00:45:12] need to run this as a loop, right? The
[00:45:14] only thing I need out of this is the AFK
[00:45:16] agent to take on a specific task and do
[00:45:18] that task.
[00:45:19] >> The way I mostly think about these
[00:45:21] things as cues, okay, cues, not loops.
[00:45:26] The Q is really the backlog of tasks
[00:45:28] that I need to complete. I'm looking at
[00:45:30] the Sand Castle issues right now. These
[00:45:32] are bug reports coming in about uh Sand
[00:45:34] Castle feature requests, things like
[00:45:36] that. I need to scope the item. Let's
[00:45:38] say it's this for instance. So, I've
[00:45:41] done a bit of triage here. It's um sort
[00:45:43] of explored. Okay, is this trivial? Is
[00:45:45] this possible? This uh was done AFK,
[00:45:48] right? So, this this item has been
[00:45:50] picked off the queue. It's been
[00:45:51] explored, been put back on the queue. I
[00:45:53] might then need to go and actually
[00:45:55] implement this. Uh looks like yeah, this
[00:45:57] looks pretty good. I'll actually add the
[00:45:59] agent implement label and I'll go and
[00:46:02] implement this in my GitHub action sand
[00:46:04] castle setup that I was talking about
[00:46:05] earlier.
[00:46:06] >> Now, this isn't a loop really like it's
[00:46:08] sort of just uh it's a queue that
[00:46:11] eventually gets resolved. This will come
[00:46:13] off the queue once it gets um uh once
[00:46:16] the pull request gets merged. And that's
[00:46:19] all development is really. You just have
[00:46:21] a queue of tasks that you need to get
[00:46:22] done. Project managers add more stuff to
[00:46:24] the queue. You complete the tasks in the
[00:46:26] queue. Like that's how we've always done
[00:46:28] it. And there are multiple nodes picking
[00:46:29] stuff off the queue, multiple
[00:46:31] developers. And so an idea that there's
[00:46:33] a single loop that just sort of goes and
[00:46:35] completes all the tasks doesn't really
[00:46:37] match with how like you developer teams
[00:46:41] generally work when it's all sort of
[00:46:44] inside GitHub actions like this. Uh
[00:46:46] anyone any developer can add one of
[00:46:48] these labels can trigger something and
[00:46:50] can just get work going. So yeah, I I
[00:46:54] think the idea of the loop is useful but
[00:46:56] it's not the whole picture. And I think
[00:46:59] an idea of a queue where you're picking
[00:47:00] tasks off is is better. But mostly it's
[00:47:02] just sort of nonsensical really. Like
[00:47:04] when people talk about you need a loop
[00:47:06] prompting your agent,
[00:47:08] >> we're really just talking about AFK
[00:47:09] agents.
[00:47:10] >> Yeah. I guess uh when you talked, I
[00:47:12] don't know why, but the the image that
[00:47:14] came into my head is like a medieval
[00:47:15] king managing a a kingdom with like some
[00:47:18] ministers or whatever. And basically
[00:47:22] assuming you know the king knows the
[00:47:23] best know has most the most context not
[00:47:26] like a king that just like randomly got
[00:47:28] inherited empire right. So if you
[00:47:31] deployed a minister into some region,
[00:47:33] far region and you never heard from him,
[00:47:36] never gave him commands, he would be
[00:47:37] running on a loop and that could go
[00:47:39] wrong or could go right depending on you
[00:47:41] know how complex the issues are in that
[00:47:43] region, how how smart the minister is,
[00:47:45] whatever. But ultimately as as the king
[00:47:47] in that medieval kingdom, you want to do
[00:47:49] the Q approach. You want to have people
[00:47:50] come to you and say like we have a
[00:47:52] problem upcoming invasion you know or
[00:47:54] there's a famine in this region and like
[00:47:56] you have this queue of problems and you
[00:47:59] are still in charge so that would be the
[00:48:00] equivalent of a human here with you know
[00:48:02] a bunch of agents bunch of AIs still you
[00:48:05] would be prioritizing okay we have these
[00:48:08] 50 bug reports only three of them are
[00:48:10] critical let's fix those first okay we
[00:48:12] have these resources um this brand deal
[00:48:15] this company wants to work with us check
[00:48:17] their reputation first. Is that a good
[00:48:20] way for to think about it?
[00:48:22] >> Totally. And what we're doing here is
[00:48:24] like you're still able to build tons of
[00:48:26] automation into here. Let's say that I
[00:48:28] had some kind of telemetry set up for
[00:48:30] sandbox for sand castle or like an
[00:48:32] observability tool like Sentry or
[00:48:34] something. I could get a bug report from
[00:48:36] a live application uh create an issue
[00:48:38] from it immediately tag that issue as
[00:48:40] like explore the issue. Maybe the agent
[00:48:42] could return some structured data from
[00:48:44] the explore saying can we fix this
[00:48:45] immediately or does this need a human in
[00:48:47] the loop? It goes and implements it. It
[00:48:49] goes and reviews it. And then maybe it
[00:48:50] has a little tag on it saying, "Can we
[00:48:52] automatically merge this or does it
[00:48:54] finally like um ping the user to go and
[00:48:56] do it?" Like I see these systems as you
[00:49:00] need human in the loop checkpoints and
[00:49:02] you need to push those further and
[00:49:04] further right further and further
[00:49:07] towards the final thing as as or the
[00:49:09] final output as you can. So you would
[00:49:11] essentially get these like in instead of
[00:49:14] like seeing the bug report, you would
[00:49:15] see the bug report, you would see the um
[00:49:18] exploration of the codebase, you would
[00:49:20] see the fix and you see like um can we
[00:49:23] review this?
[00:49:24] >> Yeah. Just like that's that's what you
[00:49:26] get as the human instead of seeing the
[00:49:28] bug report and it's just so much richer
[00:49:31] and it means it's one button click away
[00:49:33] instead of a whole debugging session
[00:49:35] away.
[00:49:35] >> So that's I mean
[00:49:37] >> so then the question here
[00:49:39] >> where Yeah. Yeah. So the question in
[00:49:41] that situation becomes because it's not
[00:49:43] a loop right it only runs when the buck
[00:49:45] comes there's no point for it to running
[00:49:47] infinitely just paying open AI or
[00:49:48] enthropic infinitely but my question was
[00:49:51] like you know again as the AI gets more
[00:49:54] powerful where because you mentioned you
[00:49:56] push yourself further further to the
[00:49:58] right to like last step is pushing to
[00:50:01] production what are the like when does
[00:50:04] it cross the threshold where like these
[00:50:05] type of things whether it's like a small
[00:50:07] UI change you know user requests a new
[00:50:09] color scheme whatever like it could be
[00:50:11] approved automatically, right? And then
[00:50:13] maybe we go more and more. So, how does
[00:50:15] that look like? Do you see what where
[00:50:16] I'm getting at?
[00:50:17] >> Oh, how do you remove human in the loop
[00:50:19] checkpoints is what you
[00:50:20] >> Yeah. Like where do you decide basically
[00:50:22] where it's it's trivial enough for you
[00:50:24] to not even look at, right? Like maybe
[00:50:27] maybe all the agents you have which
[00:50:30] again you set up the harnesses, they
[00:50:31] have your skills, you use a good model
[00:50:34] and all the agents are like, "Okay, this
[00:50:35] is a small bug. It was just a misaligned
[00:50:37] UI element. there is no, you know,
[00:50:40] harmful intent from the user. The user
[00:50:42] isn't trying to hack the application.
[00:50:44] We're just going to merge it into prod
[00:50:45] right away. That will presumably grow
[00:50:48] like the the scope of things that could
[00:50:50] be merged to prod right away. So, how
[00:50:51] would you think about that?
[00:50:53] >> Well, what I'd say is like what do you
[00:50:55] gain from review, right?
[00:50:57] >> Sure. You gain okay like you gain the
[00:51:00] ability to gate things gate dangerous
[00:51:02] things from going into production. So,
[00:51:04] prevent um security bad stuff happening,
[00:51:07] you Yeah,
[00:51:08] >> prevent you know uh let's say uh claude
[00:51:12] code source code being leaked to the
[00:51:13] world you know you prevent that bad
[00:51:15] stuff. Um, so but you also gain uh
[00:51:20] insight into your own system into the
[00:51:22] into the plumbing, right? So you're
[00:51:24] watching the thing do its work and
[00:51:26] you're assessing did it do a good job.
[00:51:28] And so that second one, you don't want
[00:51:31] to lose that because like again we're
[00:51:33] talking about the harness, right? You
[00:51:35] want to improve your harness over time
[00:51:36] and you want some observability into it.
[00:51:38] Now you could remove some human in the
[00:51:41] loop checkpoint. So you could say, okay,
[00:51:43] this uh this PR is just an internal
[00:51:46] refactor. It just moves some code
[00:51:47] around. It doesn't actually change any
[00:51:48] behavior. And you could have an AI that
[00:51:50] kind of says, okay, you don't really
[00:51:52] need to review that one. But then who
[00:51:54] reviews the AI that's doing that, right?
[00:51:57] How do you give feedback to that over
[00:51:58] time? You probably do need to check some
[00:52:00] of the PRs that the agent says are fine
[00:52:03] to review to check if they are actually
[00:52:04] fine to review. And then you improve
[00:52:06] that over time. And so we need to think
[00:52:08] about this. We're not just reviewing the
[00:52:10] code. We're also reviewing the system
[00:52:11] that produces the code and that is
[00:52:14] important and useful but I agree the
[00:52:16] goal is to remove human in the loop
[00:52:18] checkpoints where possible definitely.
[00:52:20] So maybe the better way rather than like
[00:52:22] okay let's say in a average day for this
[00:52:25] application AI autonomously fixes 20
[00:52:28] things and pushes to production right
[00:52:30] away because they were super small at
[00:52:31] the end of the day instead of you like
[00:52:33] reviewing all these because that'll be
[00:52:35] boring and slow maybe you get a custom
[00:52:36] you know teach skill HTML file and say
[00:52:39] like okay this is the common patterns in
[00:52:41] the bugs that were fixed right so like
[00:52:42] instead of you having to go through all
[00:52:45] of the GitHub commits PRs whatever which
[00:52:48] is not really optimized for this agenda
[00:52:49] IC era. I mean again GitHub was created
[00:52:52] a long time ago. It would be a custom
[00:52:54] software, a custom HTML file, whatever
[00:52:57] that's you know knows you, your learning
[00:52:59] style, your common mistakes. It has a
[00:53:01] history of the bugs in the past, you
[00:53:03] know, whatever. And it would be more
[00:53:06] optimized to helping you improve
[00:53:07] yourself and the system.
[00:53:09] >> Totally. I mean, one really cool like
[00:53:12] what we're talking about here is in
[00:53:14] making review seamless and taking um
[00:53:17] taking the human effort out of review.
[00:53:20] One thing that I've seen people do uh
[00:53:22] which is crazy is on any front-end
[00:53:24] change, it gets the AI to record a video
[00:53:27] of itself walking through the code and
[00:53:30] like the the thing that changed. It then
[00:53:32] calls a texttospech API and overlays
[00:53:35] some speech on top. So it's like the AI
[00:53:38] is talking to you while it walks through
[00:53:39] the code and you just have a video on
[00:53:41] the PR of the thing working like that
[00:53:44] sort of richness is something that we
[00:53:46] should be building into everything that
[00:53:48] we do and trying to optimize for human
[00:53:50] review and make human review faster
[00:53:52] because everyone's sort of moaning about
[00:53:54] you know like oh man we've got so much
[00:53:55] code to review but probably you could be
[00:53:57] using AI to help you review the code
[00:54:01] right like in in all sorts of
[00:54:02] interesting ways that I think we're just
[00:54:04] scratching the surface of Absolutely. So
[00:54:08] a lot of people want to build something
[00:54:09] with AI, right? Whether like you could
[00:54:11] start with some personal tools, some you
[00:54:14] know something for your team, but a lot
[00:54:16] of people want to build a like business,
[00:54:17] whether it's AI startup, whether it's
[00:54:19] some other business. How would you think
[00:54:20] about that? Like you know, a lot of
[00:54:23] people there's there's a group of people
[00:54:24] who say like, oh yeah, SAS, you know,
[00:54:26] subscriptions, they're going to be more
[00:54:28] valuable than ever because you're going
[00:54:29] to be adding more seats for the agents.
[00:54:31] There's a group of people who say like
[00:54:32] SAS is dead. How are you thinking about
[00:54:34] building a business, building software
[00:54:36] in the age of AI?
[00:54:39] >> Well, I I don't think that much has
[00:54:41] changed about it to be honest. Um, like
[00:54:43] again, I'm not a pundit. I don't really
[00:54:45] watch markets. I don't really like care
[00:54:47] whether SAS dies or thrives. Um, like if
[00:54:50] you're building a business, what you
[00:54:51] need to do is the fundamental stuff. You
[00:54:53] need to go and talk to customers. You
[00:54:54] need to figure out what they need. And
[00:54:55] then you need to build stuff um like you
[00:54:58] need to build prototypes that look like
[00:55:00] what they need and solve their actual
[00:55:01] problem. I don't think anything has
[00:55:03] changed there and I think you can learn
[00:55:04] to do that and be better with it but I
[00:55:06] don't think AI gives you any particular
[00:55:08] advantage there because what you need to
[00:55:10] do is go out in the real world and have
[00:55:12] conversations and figure out what it
[00:55:13] actually is people need. So I think all
[00:55:16] of the classic product design books will
[00:55:18] still make sense here. It's just you
[00:55:21] have a massive leg up when it comes to
[00:55:22] actually implementing it and the
[00:55:24] procedures they talk about you can start
[00:55:26] delegating them to AI too. So mostly
[00:55:29] though, it's just about having the right
[00:55:31] idea and building the right thing. And
[00:55:33] that's not something that AI can help
[00:55:35] with. If you're not also talking to
[00:55:38] actual people and figuring out what they
[00:55:40] want, as soon as you figure out what
[00:55:41] people want, um, you're good to go.
[00:55:44] >> Yeah, I think that's actually the thing
[00:55:45] that AI is notoriously bad at is like
[00:55:48] the original ideas out of the box. And
[00:55:50] uh yeah, like that would be probably one
[00:55:53] of the main pieces of advice I would
[00:55:54] give to people is like you need to be
[00:55:56] choosing the features that get added,
[00:55:58] right? If you see somebody who's like
[00:55:59] delegating all of that, it's like what's
[00:56:01] the next big thing we should add? It's
[00:56:02] like no, you should be in charge of the
[00:56:04] product. You could Yeah, obviously you
[00:56:06] don't have to like learn the exact
[00:56:08] syntax or whatever. You don't have to
[00:56:09] read every file, but like you cannot be
[00:56:11] asking the AI to build your app. Like
[00:56:13] you need to have the vision. You need to
[00:56:14] know why you're building it and like
[00:56:16] what problem it's solving.
[00:56:17] >> Absolutely. You should be asking AI what
[00:56:19] thing you can remove from your app.
[00:56:21] Basically, you should be asking how do I
[00:56:23] make this simpler? How do I improve the
[00:56:24] UX? How do I actually focus in on what
[00:56:27] people want instead of ending up like
[00:56:29] you know uh one of those dreadful uh VC
[00:56:31] funded apps that we've all seen where
[00:56:33] there's a thousand features and uh you
[00:56:35] can't find the thing that you want to
[00:56:36] do. So again, this is just product
[00:56:38] design fundamentals.
[00:56:40] >> We mentioned that senior devs get like
[00:56:42] 10x improvement and you know speed up.
[00:56:46] How do you because from my experience
[00:56:48] that's true but only if they actually
[00:56:50] used the AI tools. There's a group of
[00:56:52] there still developers still that are
[00:56:54] kind of refusing to believe it or you
[00:56:55] know AI is not that good. They tried it
[00:56:56] a year ago two years ago they were you
[00:56:58] know disappointed but obviously tools
[00:57:00] harnesses models are much better. But my
[00:57:03] counterargument or maybe it's not a
[00:57:04] counter argument is like what about just
[00:57:07] hiring the true if you were hiring
[00:57:09] hiring young people who are true
[00:57:11] believers in AI who like know these
[00:57:14] tools inside and out. They use them all
[00:57:15] the time. They know what's the best
[00:57:17] model, what's the best skill, what's the
[00:57:18] best, you know, agent in each situation.
[00:57:21] And obviously, they need to have some
[00:57:23] technical fundamentals. But like, how
[00:57:25] would you reconcile this tension of like
[00:57:28] these are seniors who have 10, 15, 20
[00:57:31] years of experience and they get a 10x
[00:57:33] versus these are like true AI believers
[00:57:36] who might not have as much experience as
[00:57:38] the seniors, but like are better
[00:57:40] operators at using the AI? Well, hiring
[00:57:44] great juniors has always been the goal
[00:57:46] of any company basically because if you
[00:57:47] find a great junior then anyone who's
[00:57:49] enthusiastic will do a better job than
[00:57:52] someone who's more experienced basically
[00:57:54] like enthusiasm beats experience just in
[00:57:57] pure output and because they develop so
[00:57:59] much faster and they learn so much
[00:58:01] faster. And so people who are really uh
[00:58:03] excited about this new age and know a
[00:58:06] lot about this stuff, if you can just
[00:58:07] pair that with a little bit of software
[00:58:09] fundamentals with because what we're
[00:58:11] talking about here is I think of there
[00:58:14] as being a difference between DX
[00:58:15] developer experience and AX, right?
[00:58:18] Agent experience. And so agent
[00:58:21] experience is the experience that the
[00:58:23] agent has working in the codebase. And
[00:58:25] anything you can do whether that's um um
[00:58:28] better skills um you know increasing the
[00:58:30] power of the model works of course um
[00:58:32] you know improving the harness and
[00:58:34] improving the codebase as well is like
[00:58:36] that's amazing often people forget about
[00:58:39] improving the codebase actually for
[00:58:41] better AX you know improve about uh they
[00:58:44] forget about all the edges you can get
[00:58:45] with like good software fundamentals and
[00:58:48] so that's where the senior will be
[00:58:50] useful because the senior knows how to
[00:58:52] build good DX right they know how do if
[00:58:55] they're a good senior, they know how to
[00:58:57] build a codebase that can work well with
[00:58:59] humans. And there's a huge overlap
[00:59:01] between good DX and good AX, but they're
[00:59:05] just coming at it like the junior who's
[00:59:07] great at AI is just coming at the
[00:59:09] problem from a different point of view
[00:59:10] from the um senior. Um what was your
[00:59:13] original question? How do they get hired
[00:59:14] or like how do you or like you hire out
[00:59:17] of both of them?
[00:59:18] >> Sure. But not not like who would you
[00:59:20] hire but like who will maybe get more
[00:59:22] alpha you know who be more valuable like
[00:59:24] is it like the senior who has a lot of
[00:59:25] these experiences you know the right way
[00:59:27] of thinking about software but maybe
[00:59:29] isn't as true of AI believer and versus
[00:59:32] somebody who's like fully embracing AI
[00:59:35] to the maximum and knows how to use it
[00:59:36] to the fullest.
[00:59:38] >> I think if you have an experimental
[00:59:39] mindset and you're excited about AI then
[00:59:42] you're going to get a ton out of it
[00:59:43] whether you're junior or senior. And I
[00:59:45] think again if you're intrigued by the
[00:59:47] harness first of all and intrigued by
[00:59:50] improving AX everywhere that you can
[00:59:52] then you're gonna you're gonna thrive
[00:59:54] and love it. Now there's obviously a lot
[00:59:56] of like good reasons that people have
[00:59:58] for not wanting to get on the AI train.
[01:00:00] You know they might um just be a bit you
[01:00:03] know squeamish with the ethical stuff.
[01:00:05] You know like anthropic stealing
[01:00:07] everyone's um novels and just sort of
[01:00:09] pumping them into Claude. Um, but
[01:00:13] like it is here and it's that's how the
[01:00:17] job is now. You know, if you're just a
[01:00:19] tactical programmer just plumbing away
[01:00:22] doing your work, you're gone, right?
[01:00:24] Like that's out. You know, you can't be
[01:00:26] a code monkey anymore. You need to think
[01:00:27] strategically. And so seniors can
[01:00:29] absolutely make the most of that. But
[01:00:31] juniors can learn that, too.
[01:00:33] >> All right. My closing question is going
[01:00:34] to be practical for the people watching.
[01:00:37] If you could take the average AI
[01:00:40] enthusiast and give him like one or two
[01:00:42] action steps to do today to either
[01:00:44] improve his setup, improve his harness,
[01:00:46] learn something, what would those one or
[01:00:48] two things be?
[01:00:49] >> First thing I would do is I would delete
[01:00:51] every single skill, every single plugin,
[01:00:53] every single MCP server. I would go
[01:00:54] back. I' delete your claw.md, delete
[01:00:56] your agents.mmd, go back to absolutely
[01:00:59] nothing, and then observe the agent. See
[01:01:01] what it does. In my experience, everyone
[01:01:03] bloats up their context window with too
[01:01:06] much stuff, with too many instructions.
[01:01:08] Go back to a blank slate and see what
[01:01:12] the agent does. Once you're seeing what
[01:01:14] the agent does in that basic um sort of
[01:01:17] mode, then layer things on top of it and
[01:01:20] make sure those things are procedures,
[01:01:22] procedure skills, not um ability skills.
[01:01:26] Layer things on that you yourself
[01:01:27] decide. And my skills repo is is a great
[01:01:30] place to start there. If you really miss
[01:01:32] something, if you really miss like
[01:01:34] brainstorming from superpowers, then
[01:01:35] bring that back. If you miss this, if
[01:01:37] you miss that and make sure that you
[01:01:39] install them in a way that you can
[01:01:40] customize them, you can play around with
[01:01:42] them and experiment, you know. Um, if
[01:01:45] you're noticing problems, then try to
[01:01:46] find solutions to fix those problems and
[01:01:49] try as much as you can to delegate the
[01:01:51] implementation to an AFK agent. Um, AFK
[01:01:54] is just incredible way to work. It's
[01:01:57] just takes a little bit of setup, but
[01:01:58] once it's set up, it's just goes crazy.
[01:02:02] >> Right, V? Appreciate your time. Where
[01:02:04] should people find you?
[01:02:05] >> Uh, find me on Twitter, find me at
[01:02:07] aihero.dev, and I've got a newsletter
[01:02:09] where I post about all this stuff. So,
[01:02:10] aihero.dev, especially if you want to
[01:02:13] learn about my skills and learn about
[01:02:14] updates to them, then go to
[01:02:16] aihero.dev/skills.
[01:02:18] >> All right, I'm going to link all of that
[01:02:19] below. Once again, thank you for your
[01:02:21] time, Matt, and have a great day. Now
[01:02:23] where is David?
