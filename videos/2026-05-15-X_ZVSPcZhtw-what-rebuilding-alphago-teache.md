## Summary

Eric Jang discusses rebuilding AlphaGo from scratch to understand why deep learning solved Go, a problem previously thought intractable. He covers Go's rules and the staggering game tree complexity (roughly 361^300 possible outcomes), then explains Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as the core algorithm that efficiently explores this tree by balancing exploitation (Q-values measuring move quality) and exploration (trying less-visited branches). The key insight is that neural networks accelerate this search: a policy network predicts promising moves, while a value network estimates win probability from any board state—mimicking how humans instantly evaluate positions without playing out every possible future. Jang details the architecture choices, explaining why ResNets outperform Transformers for this task with limited training data, and how global feature aggregation helps the network connect distant board positions.

For practitioners, the actionable takeaway is that AlphaGo's techniques are now implementable with modern LLMs and modest compute (KataGo demonstrated 40x efficiency gains, reducing millions of dollars of compute to thousands). To apply this approach: combine MCTS search with trained neural networks for value and policy predictions in any game or sequential decision problem; use ResNet-style architectures when data is limited; and incorporate global feature pooling if the domain requires considering non-local dependencies. The project demonstrates that classical game tree search combined with deep learning is more tractable than either approach alone—a principle applicable beyond Go to any complex decision domain.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Today, I'm here with Eric Jang, who was  most recently vice president of AI at 1X
[00:00:04] Technologies, and before that, senior research  scientist at what is now Google DeepMind Robotics.
[00:00:10] You've been on sabbatical for the last few months. One of the things you've been doing is rebuilding,
[00:00:15] improving, and hacking on AlphaGo. Today, you're going to explain building
[00:00:21] AlphaGo from scratch and what it tells us about  the future of AI research and development.
[00:00:26] Before we get to that, why is AlphaGo interesting? Why is this the project you decided to do on
[00:00:31] sabbatical rather than just  hanging out at the beach?
[00:00:34] I like making things, and AlphaGo and Go AI is one  of those things that really got me into the field.
[00:00:40] When I saw the early breakthroughs on  AlphaGo in 2014, 2015, 2016 and so forth,
[00:00:46] it was profound to see how smart AI systems  could become and the computational complexity
[00:00:53] class they could tackle with deep learning. This is a problem that has long been understood
[00:00:59] to be intractable for search, and yet  it was solved through deep learning.
[00:01:07] That was quite mysterious to  me, and I've always wanted
[00:01:09] to understand that phenomenon a little better. My training is in deep neural nets for robotics,
[00:01:14] where the decisions made by the neural  networks are a bit more intuitive.
[00:01:19] But AlphaGo is a problem where the decisions  are the result of a very, very deep search.
[00:01:26] It's always been very mysterious to me how a  ten-layer network can amortize the simulation
[00:01:31] of something so deep in the game tree. If you plot out how much compute it took
[00:01:38] to build various iterations of strong Go  bots over the years, you can see that in
[00:01:42] 2020 there was an open-source project called  KataGo by David Wu from Jane Street, which
[00:01:49] achieved a 40x reduction in the compute needed  to train a really strong Go bot tabula rasa.
[00:01:54] I'm not certain if it's stronger than AlphaGo  Zero, AlphaZero, or MuZero, but it's very strong,
[00:01:59] and this is what most Go practitioners today  train against when they're playing an AI.
[00:02:04] Thanks to LLM coding, what took a whole team of  research scientists at DeepMind and millions of
[00:02:09] dollars of research and compute can now be done  for a few thousand dollars of rented compute.
[00:02:14] We should first discuss how Go  works. How does the game work?
[00:02:19] Go is a very simple game that can be  implemented quickly and easily on a computer.
[00:02:24] The objective is to put down  black and white stones and
[00:02:29] try to occupy as much territory as possible. I might start by putting down a black stone.
[00:02:34] Black always goes first. Go ahead. The way  you capture an opponent's stones is that
[00:02:38] for every intersection, if you can surround  all four of its neighbors with your stones,
[00:02:45] then it's cut off from oxygen, if  you will, and it's a dead stone.
[00:02:53] Now I control these four stones as  well as this empty intersection here.
[00:02:57] There are slight variations between Chinese,  Japanese, and what are called Tromp-Taylor rules.
[00:03:03] Tromp-Taylor rules are designed to  be completely unambiguous, so this
[00:03:06] is what all Go AIs train and resolve against. In typical Go, when humans play, you're actually
[00:03:12] not allowed to put this white stone down here. It  would be instant suicide. In Tromp-Taylor, it's
[00:03:17] actually fine. You put it down, and it immediately  resolves to death, so the outcome is the same.
[00:03:22] Let's start over and play a few stones, and then  I'll explain some more. I'll just start there.
[00:03:32] I'm basically playing randomly here, but  I'm trying to get around your stones and
[00:03:36] see if I can surround them. This move exposes one empty
[00:03:48] neighbor for your white stone. It's akin to a check in chess.
[00:03:53] If you don't respond immediately by putting  one here, then I can immediately capture this.
[00:03:57] I see. Because it's the diagonals that  determine whether you're surrounded or not.
[00:04:01] The cross-section, not the diagonals.  This one is surrounded on three sides,
[00:04:06] so you're at threat of losing that stone  if you don't play one immediately there.
[00:04:11] Now you can see that I'm starting to pressure  you, because by putting a stone here,
[00:04:16] you're forced to put one here. Otherwise, you would have this
[00:04:20] two-block to yourself. Yes. And if you think
[00:04:23] through what happens if you were  to respond here, you can probably
[00:04:27] search into the future and deduce what  I'll do in response once you do that.
[00:04:31] You have a lot of confidence in my abilities,  but I'm guessing you'd put the black here.
[00:04:35] That's right, and then I would  capture all three of these stones.
[00:04:37] So I should just assume that  this little block is gone.
[00:04:40] Yes. In Go, it's actually okay to let  an opponent capture some stones if,
[00:04:45] for example, it lets you position to capture  more stones somewhere else on the board.
[00:04:50] This is what makes Go a beautiful game:  you can lose the battle but win the war.
[00:04:56] As the board size increases, the  complexity of these micro versus macro
[00:05:01] dynamics gets more interesting. Presumably you'd put one here.
[00:05:06] So now I would capture this entire  group, and this would be mine.
[00:05:10] There's one more case I want to demonstrate, which  I actually had a bug in my code for recently.
[00:05:18] Let's consider a formation like this,  with other pieces on the board in play.
[00:05:28] Let's talk about how the game ends. In this territory, who controls these
[00:05:35] areas? Is it white or black? White.
[00:05:38] It's actually black, because  I've surrounded this whole area.
[00:05:43] Assuming I have other black stones here,  it's very hard for you to break this
[00:05:48] out of the control of these stones. And when the final score is tallied,
[00:05:51] would these ones also count as being in... Great question. This is where different rule
[00:05:57] sets have different ways of scoring. We should talk about how you resolve
[00:06:02] scores between humans and how you resolve  scores in computer Go, because there's some
[00:06:06] ambiguity in how humans evaluate this. Most humans would look at this board
[00:06:11] configuration and conclude that black has totally  surrounded white, and white has no chance of life.
[00:06:16] We could play out more here, but at  the end I would capture everything.
[00:06:21] However, if you have a way of breaking  this formation and connecting white to
[00:06:24] something outside of it, then it can flip. This is where it's a little bit hard for a
[00:06:30] computer to decide these kinds of things. How  do humans do it? It's worth thinking about how
[00:06:34] humans resolve this, because this will map later  to how we think about the deep neural network.
[00:06:40] Humans basically say, "I think the game  is done," and then you have to also say,
[00:06:45] "I think the game is done." Then we'll say, "I think these
[00:06:47] are my stones," and you have to agree. If you don't agree, we keep playing.
[00:06:53] Essentially, once two humans—their so-called  value function—agree on a consensus, then the
[00:06:59] Chinese rules resolve that. In Tromp-Taylor scoring,
[00:07:04] it's perfectly unambiguous, so it can be  decided algorithmically by a computer.
[00:07:09] If you have this at the endgame, the way you  score it is that you first count how many
[00:07:15] stones you control, and that's unambiguous. Then you count how many empty intersections
[00:07:20] are not touched by your opponent's stones. These intersections would not count for either
[00:07:25] player, because all of these intersections are  connected to both white stones and black stones.
[00:07:31] If this were like this, then  white would get three points.
[00:07:36] This is a little odd because a human would know  that white is actually losing these points.
[00:07:42] But Tromp-Taylor scoring would consider white to  have all of these points as well as these points.
[00:07:48] So that is a very big difference in how computer  Go scores things and how humans score things.
[00:07:53] How does the game end? The game ends when either
[00:07:56] a player chooses to resign or both players  pass consecutively. Those are the rules.
[00:08:04] Now help me crack this with AI. Let's understand how AlphaGo
[00:08:10] actually works and how somebody in the  audience might be able to implement it.
[00:08:13] Let's start with an intuition about the  underlying search process used to make moves,
[00:08:21] and we'll layer on ideas from deep learning  to make it much more efficient and tractable.
[00:08:27] Go is a game with just two players. We're going to draw a person here,
[00:08:31] and we're going to draw an AI here. Let's say this person is playing black,
[00:08:38] so they go first. They go here. Now the AI is  going to make a move based on what it sees here.
[00:08:51] There's a question of how you  encode these inputs into the AI.
[00:08:54] Maybe you could use ones and zeros, but you  want to represent black, white, and empty.
[00:09:00] You would need at least three different values. Maybe you could use zeros, ones, and twos.
[00:09:05] The AI might see something like  zero, zero, zero, zero, one.
[00:09:23] This is the input to the AI on its turn. The AI  can choose. Let's just pick three possible random
[00:09:29] moves it can make, and I just drew these  at random. Which move is best here? Well,
[00:09:33] we don't know until the game ends. Go doesn't have any kind of local
[00:09:37] reward for which move here is good. This is what makes Go a very difficult game.
[00:09:41] You don't actually know who won until you really  get to the end. How deep is this tree? On a 19x19
[00:09:49] Go board, there are roughly on the order of  361 moves on any given move, and of course,
[00:09:56] as it fills up, you have fewer moves. The number of steps in the game
[00:10:02] can be somewhere from 250 to 300 moves. Experts might decide to end the game well before
[00:10:08] that, but under Tromp-Taylor scoring, you actually  have to play things all the way to the end.
[00:10:12] So this could be 300 moves,  a depth of 300 in the tree.
[00:10:19] If you keep on expanding possible moves—here  the AI goes, then here the human would go,
[00:10:27] and so forth—you find that  you end up with an enormous
[00:10:41] explosion in the possible game outcomes  originating from just this one state.
[00:10:48] This is something on the order of 361³⁰⁰, which is  far more than the number of atoms in the universe.
[00:10:58] Of course, there are redundancies and symmetries,  so it's not actually that, but if you were to do
[00:11:04] a naive tree with no merging of children,  you end up with a tree about this big.
[00:11:09] What do you mean by "merging of children"? Let me use this board here.
[00:11:13] If we start here, and then you play here,  and then I play here, and then you play here,
[00:11:20] that's equivalent to me starting here, you playing  here, me playing here, and then you playing here.
[00:11:28] Both arrived at the same spot,  but through different paths.
[00:11:30] So this child node can be  thought of as a shared ancestor.
[00:11:34] Got it. And I guess it starts at 361  but it decreases by one each time.
[00:11:38] Yes, the branching factor  decreases by one each time.
[00:11:41] In any case, this is a very large tree. This is also why computer scientists for
[00:11:47] many years thought that Go was not  a tractable problem this century.
[00:11:50] The amount of compute you  would need to exhaustively
[00:11:53] search every possibility is just too large. If you could, Go is actually a deterministic game.
[00:12:00] In any given state, you can compute  the best possible strategy you can
[00:12:06] make in order to win the game. You can search all the possible
[00:12:09] futures where you win, and then just make  sure you always stay in that set of futures.
[00:12:16] AlphaGo's core conceptual breakthrough was using  neural nets to make this search problem tractable.
[00:12:23] Before we get into how neural networks  are involved, let's talk about how we can,
[00:12:29] assuming we had a powerful enough computer,  search this tree to find the best move.
[00:12:35] In the beginning, you're not  going to build out the whole tree,
[00:12:39] because storing it would be very expensive. Instead, you might interactively figure out
[00:12:44] which leaves of this tree are worthy  of exploring and expanding into the
[00:12:48] future to see what else is there. There are some early algorithms in
[00:12:54] the bandit literature like UCB1, which is not  exactly appropriate for a sequential game like Go,
[00:13:02] but very much inspired the action  selection algorithm used in AlphaGo.
[00:13:08] UCB1 looks like: on every move, we're going  to take the best action—the argmax over a that
[00:13:16] maximizes Q of a, and I'll explain what Q of a is  in a moment—plus some sort of exploration bonus.
[00:13:34] On every node, we're going  to track a few quantities.
[00:13:38] Let's consider each of these a node. This is the root node where you're
[00:13:43] making decisions from, and these  are the children of the root node.
[00:13:50] Each node is basically a data structure that  stores a visit count of this child node.
[00:14:04] How often the parent visited this node. Yes. One thing that's easy to trip on if you
[00:14:09] come from robotics or other kinds of reinforcement  learning is, where are the actions? I'm only
[00:14:15] talking about nodes. Nodes here represent states,  and because this is a perfectly deterministic
[00:14:21] game with no randomness, you actually can  just infer the action based on the child.
[00:14:26] If I go here, that implies an action,  and this is the state we resolve to.
[00:14:32] If you ask LLMs to vibe-code an MCTS  implementation, they will most likely
[00:14:37] design the right data structure here. But it's sort of a chef's choice.
[00:14:41] You can rewrite the tree  structure however you like.
[00:14:44] This is what Claude 4.6 wrote for me when I  asked it, and it was a very reasonable choice.
[00:14:52] Qₐ represents the mean  action value of this action.
[00:15:02] I'll use a subscript a to denote that  this corresponds to taking a specific
[00:15:05] action to get here from the root node. Taking a gets us to this node here.
[00:15:17] We're also going to store the  probability of taking this action
[00:15:22] Again, from the parent? From the parent, yes. What are the odds that we
[00:15:26] sample this one? This will become relevant later.  We've talked about a deterministic tree for now,
[00:15:32] so I'll bring probabilities into this later. Finally, we have a dictionary of children,
[00:15:39] which is just more of these nodes in a  classic linked list-style reference tree.
[00:15:45] This is the basic data  structure to implement a tree.
[00:15:50] In AlphaGo, they use a slightly different  action-selection criterion called PUCT,
[00:15:56] short for Predicted Upper Confidence with Trees. When you select which child to take,
[00:16:06] you do argmax a of Q(s,a) plus a constant. The equation forms are pretty similar. These
[00:16:34] are both scoring criteria. You want to argmax this  quantity and you want to argmax this quantity to
[00:16:38] determine which action to take. Let's break down the intuition
[00:16:41] of how you select actions here. Q(s,a) is the mean action value,
[00:16:46] so how good a given child is on average. If you actually knew the whole tree,
[00:16:52] this is all you need to select the best action. You don't really need to do more than that.
[00:16:56] But if you're interactively building this tree as  you're figuring out what the Q values should be,
[00:17:01] then occasionally you have to try some other  actions as an explore-versus-exploit trade-off.
[00:17:08] In both UCB and PUCT, there's  this term that basically rewards
[00:17:13] taking actions you haven't taken before. As we mentioned, each node stores the visit
[00:17:19] count of taking that specific action. Everything  is initialized to zero. For a given action,
[00:17:25] let's call it action a, initially it's zero. As n is increasing, if we've already made 10
[00:17:36] action selections from that root  node but we haven't picked a yet,
[00:17:40] then this term starts to become quite large for a. Conversely, if we've chosen a 10 times out of 10,
[00:17:47] then this term is quite small. It diminishes  very quickly. The same thing is true here.
[00:17:53] Just to make sure I'm understanding, let me put it  in my own words. Let's focus on UCB. Conceptually,
[00:18:03] you can think of it as two different  things: the Q and the exploration term.
[00:18:09] Let's be clear about what Q is. Q is basically saying, once we do
[00:18:12] these rollouts—you're actually running all these  simulations—you go down the tree and figure out:
[00:18:17] if I end up at the terminal value of  this tree, do I win this game or not?
[00:18:23] You average whether I win or not across all the  leaves of this tree starting from this node.
[00:18:31] That average, you put in Q. So Q represents the probability that
[00:18:38] I'll win this game starting at this node. That is your sort of exploit.
[00:18:42] It's saying: I've run these simulations,  and I think this is a good move or not.
[00:18:46] The other term is saying: have I  explored this branch enough yet
[00:18:51] relative to the other actions I could  be exploring, or have already explored?
[00:18:56] If I haven't explored this branch  yet, maybe I think it has a low score,
[00:18:59] but I just haven't explored that many  leaves down this node in this tree.
[00:19:06] So I should try this even though Q, the exploit  term, is telling me it's not that valuable.
[00:19:11] Because ln(n) grows slower than n, over time  you will move from the argmax being dominated
[00:19:22] by the exploration term, which is the second term  here, to the argmax being dominated by the Q term,
[00:19:27] which is when you've done enough simulations and  are confident that this is the branch to go down.
[00:19:33] Yes, that's right. The motivation for UCB  was to come up with an algorithm where,
[00:19:39] if you don't know the payoff of the different  actions you can select, this strategy,
[00:19:47] given some exploration term here, bounds your  regret in terms of how wrong you can possibly
[00:19:52] be. I don't know the proof. I also don't know  if this one is proved to have logarithmically or
[00:19:58] square-root-bounded regret, but I think the  algorithm was derived to look something like this.
[00:20:02] You can tell these terms grow a little  differently, and this is to account for the
[00:20:06] fact that Go has many more actions for any given  move compared to your standard bandit problem.
[00:20:13] One small clarification: you talked  about simulations and probabilities.
[00:20:18] We should remember that Go  fundamentally is a deterministic game.
[00:20:22] Where does the notion of  probability come from here?
[00:20:27] If you had a very powerful computer,  there are no probabilities.
[00:20:32] You can just compute the true  average of the mean action value.
[00:20:36] So where does the probability come in? In computer Go before AlphaGo,
[00:20:44] we've always done some sort of Monte Carlo method  where we take the expected Q value averaged over
[00:20:52] a randomly selected tree. That randomly selected
[00:20:56] tree is where probabilities come in. The interpretation of Q is: what is the expected
[00:21:02] action value under the random distribution  induced by some random search process?
[00:21:10] Where does the random search process come in? That's where Pₐ, of action, comes in.
[00:21:15] If we assume a naive algorithm where you have a  uniform probability of taking any valid action,
[00:21:20] then this would just be one  over the number of valid moves.
[00:21:26] You would be taking this average  over a very diffuse tree.
[00:21:31] This is a valid integral, but it's very slow  because you're going to consider a lot of trees
[00:21:36] that have very low value. It's essentially almost
[00:21:39] like an importance sampling problem. Only a few actions and paths contribute high
[00:21:47] value, and almost everything else is low value. So that's a tricky problem here.
[00:21:55] This is the action selection criterion  for how you decide which moves to go down.
[00:22:00] As you move down in tree search, you  will eventually run into a node where
[00:22:06] it's quite clear you've won or lost. At the very end of the game, when there
[00:22:10] are no valid moves left to play under Tromp-Taylor  scoring, you can decide whether you won or lost.
[00:22:22] This is the final return of the whole game. We can assign a value, U, to a terminal leaf
[00:22:37] node of the tree, but how do we assign values  to the nodes prior to that, the parents?
[00:22:44] You take the mean action value,  which is essentially your average.
[00:22:52] Suppose these were all leaf nodes. The mean action value of this node
[00:23:01] is just the average of whether  you won or lost at the leaf nodes.
[00:23:07] Correspondingly, you can walk up the chain and say  the mean action value of this node—let's call it
[00:23:12] Qb—is just a weighted average of these ones here. The weighted average could depend on whether
[00:23:23] you have a different sampling distribution. But the basic intuition is that you want to
[00:23:27] resolve the game where you have a deterministic  win or lose, and then you can go backwards—this
[00:23:33] is called the backup step—and assign values  to these nodes or actions corresponding
[00:23:40] to the average over the final terminal leaf. If you were to do this without neural networks,
[00:23:47] it would still be intractable. You would have trouble finding
[00:23:51] which actions to sample. A lot of the actions would
[00:23:55] contribute very low value, especially if you're  trying to fight your way out of a losing position.
[00:24:00] Only a few actions give you high value, so the  search in practice is still very expensive.
[00:24:05] But the idea is that because Go follows a  tree structure, you can inform a very good
[00:24:14] estimate of the value of this node based  on the downstream values, assuming they're
[00:24:19] all correct and you've searched deep enough. Your earlier explanation—about the sorts of
[00:24:25] states where it's obvious to a human who's going  to win, but deterministically you still have to
[00:24:31] play it out—actually drew upon the intuition for  why 1) the value function is both trainable and 2)
[00:24:39] necessary in order to learn this game effectively. Maybe it's worth defining value
[00:24:45] in the first place. We talked about U being your
[00:24:51] final resolution of whether you won or lost. This is a terminal leaf node condition.
[00:24:56] Humans don't play all the way  to the leaves of the tree.
[00:25:00] They stop dozens of moves before, maybe even 100  moves before in high-level play. How do they know?
[00:25:09] You can think about humans as implicitly having  a neural network called a value function that
[00:25:16] takes in a board state and evaluates p(win). The human glances at the board and knows,
[00:25:27] "I'm probably going to lose." They're essentially running a neural
[00:25:30] network that looks at a board and implicitly  amortizes a huge number of possible game playouts.
[00:25:38] They take that average and decide whether the  board is winnable or not, and whether they should
[00:25:42] concede or keep playing. This is remarkable. If  you think about the beauty of something like this,
[00:25:51] a neural network in a human can somehow  do all of this simulation at a glance.
[00:25:57] They just know within a few seconds, without  actually playing every single game logically,
[00:26:03] based on crystallized knowledge and  experience. They can do this. This
[00:26:07] gives us a hint that in games like Go, there are  ways to radically speed up the search process.
[00:26:14] This is one of the fundamental  intuitions behind why AlphaGo works.
[00:26:18] You can train a value function to look at a board  and quickly resolve the game without playing out
[00:26:25] all of these trees to a very deep search depth. Makes sense. I will say for the audience,
[00:26:36] for previous episodes when I was prepping and  it seemed relevant to understand how AlphaGo
[00:26:39] works, I would find it very confusing. But it's the kind of thing where once you
[00:26:44] understand the problem in this way and then build  the next few pieces, it is actually a lot more
[00:26:49] understandable and it makes a lot of sense. It's okay to be confused right now,
[00:26:53] but it's probably simpler to understand, by  the end of this lecture, than you anticipate.
[00:26:59] I’ll just make that note for the audience. The important intuition at a high level—to
[00:27:03] step back about where we're going with all  this—is that classically, for games like Go,
[00:27:09] you could build a tree, but we don't  have computers powerful enough for that.
[00:27:15] Estimating the value of every action you  could possibly take is also hard because
[00:27:19] you don't know until the end of the game. You could take averages by playing them to the
[00:27:24] end, but that's also hard because you don't know  which actions to take to sample these averages.
[00:27:30] Conceptually, there are two problems: the  breadth of the tree and the depth of the tree.
[00:27:35] AlphaGo gives us a way to shrink  both of those to be tractable.
[00:27:41] That's essentially the core idea behind it. We take the idea that humans can glance at a
[00:27:47] board and instantly predict whether we win. That maybe gives us the opportunity to
[00:27:51] truncate how deep we search. We also know that humans can
[00:28:06] intuitively, at a glance, decide what  moves might be good on a Go board.
[00:28:10] These are two things we can use deep neural  networks for, to accelerate the search process.
[00:28:16] Before we talk about neural nets, let's  go back to how this playout works.
[00:28:20] We've only talked about making one move. The AI looks at this encoded Go board. It
[00:28:25] has a tree. It searches deeply into the tree to  find out which of its actions might be the best,
[00:28:32] takes that action, and goes back to the human. Now the human sees a Go board that looks like
[00:28:40] this, and they make their move. Maybe they put their stone here.
[00:28:50] Now we go back to the AI, which  now looks at a new encoded board.
[00:29:07] I've used 2 to denote the AI  playing as white, 1 to denote the
[00:29:11] human playing as black, and 0 as empty. On the AI's turn, it does the MCTS tree
[00:29:17] search all over again from scratch. It throws away the old tree that it
[00:29:21] searched last round. Now there's a new root
[00:29:23] node and it begins to search anew. You can basically think about MCTS
[00:29:31] as a search algorithm that decides  which moves to play best, aided by
[00:29:36] neural networks, and it's done on every move. Let's talk about the neural network part of this.
[00:29:46] While you're erasing, another thing that was  important for me to understand was about the MCTS
[00:29:52] data structure with nodes and children of nodes. This is done per move and reinstantiated
[00:30:00] once a move is made. A human makes a move,
[00:30:03] then the AI looks at this and runs a bunch of  simulations to figure out what move to make next.
[00:30:12] A simulation is exploring one  more node in the MCTS tree.
[00:30:19] Once you run 1,000 simulations, that informs  the probability of what move to make next,
[00:30:29] as you'll explain. That’s what you store. You  choose the best move given those probabilities.
[00:30:34] You discard all of that, the next player  makes a move, and you restart this process
[00:30:39] at the beginning of every move. Correct. One small addendum:
[00:30:42] you don't discard all of that. You keep one thing behind that we'll use later.
[00:30:47] Just like I did for Reiner, I wanted to  make flashcards for this episode so that
[00:30:50] people could retain these concepts. And ideally, an LLM could generate
[00:30:54] some candidates for me to then refine. But to actually get high quality suggestions,
[00:30:58] I needed to design a whole pipeline where  the AI could take and ingest screenshots of
[00:31:03] the blackboard at the right timestamps and then  make SVG diagrams in case visuals were helpful,
[00:31:08] and then run the writing and drawing through  a critic and then revise the card in response
[00:31:12] to this feedback. It's very hard to
[00:31:14] accomplish this just by stacking LLM calls. This sort of step-by-step recipe works much better
[00:31:19] if you have a durable agent that's been engaging  with the task across all the previous stages.
[00:31:23] So I used the Cursor SDK to  spin up an agent for each card.
[00:31:26] The Cursor harness saved me a bunch of work  in designing some custom context scaffold or
[00:31:31] figuring out how to design tool calls for  taking screenshots or making animations.
[00:31:36] These agents all run in the cloud, so I don't  have to worry about leaving my laptop open.
[00:31:40] I just get an email when I  have candidates to review.
[00:31:42] You can check out my cards  at flashcards.dwarkesh.com.
[00:31:47] You can start building with the  agents SDK at cursor.com/dwarkesh.
[00:31:54] Now that we have a basic intuition of how  moves are made with search, we're going to
[00:31:57] talk about how neural networks can speed this  up by providing an analog to human intuition.
[00:32:03] There are two networks. There is the value network, which takes in a
[00:32:09] state and predicts, am I going to win or lose? It's a binary classification problem.
[00:32:17] Then we have a policy network, which induces  a distribution over good actions to take.
[00:32:26] I'm going to draw a one-dimensional flattened move  distribution, but this is really a square grid.
[00:32:38] These are the probability  distributions over good actions.
[00:32:42] Both of these are categorical  classification problems.
[00:32:45] You can train this like any classifier with deep  learning, cross-entropy loss, that kind of stuff.
[00:32:54] The specific architecture  does not matter too much.
[00:32:57] I tried a few different architectures.  Transformers work, ResNets work. For
[00:33:01] small data regimes, my experience is that ResNets  still outperform transformers and give you more
[00:33:07] bang for the buck at lower budgets. But this may not always be true.
[00:33:10] Wait, why is that? They provide the
[00:33:12] inductive bias of local convolutions. Generally, transformers start to outperform
[00:33:18] residual convolutional networks  when you want more global context.
[00:33:22] One interesting finding from the KataGo paper was  that they found it quite useful to pool together
[00:33:29] and aggregate global features throughout  the network, to give the network a global
[00:33:36] sense of how to connect value from  one side of the board to the other.
[00:33:40] What does it mean to aggregate global features? If you have a very large 19x19 Go board,
[00:33:48] and you've got some battles going on here and  some battles going on there, when you pass
[00:33:55] this through a convolutional neural network, the  receptive fields are going to be good at computing
[00:34:02] local things and making that invariant. But they won't be able to connect these
[00:34:08] two features easily. They need to be pooled
[00:34:11] together and attend to each other somehow. The argument for why transformers are good
[00:34:17] for computer vision tasks—vision transformers  and so forth—is that because they have global
[00:34:23] attention across the whole thing, they  can more easily draw these connections.
[00:34:27] But you do need more data there so that you can  learn the invariant local features through data.
[00:34:36] I've tried very hard to make transformers work for  this problem because I was curious if transformers
[00:34:40] would present some sort of breakthrough in  Go and just remove a lot of those tricks.
[00:34:44] But try as I might, I haven't figured out a way  to make transformers better than ResNets for now.
[00:34:50] One more tangential question. It makes sense  why transformers, with their global pooling
[00:34:56] of information, would be better if you need to  consider information that is not just spatially…
[00:35:04] CNNs give you a bias that the things  next to you are especially relevant.
[00:35:09] And then they're aggregated up slowly. For games where it isn't that relevant
[00:35:15] what is happening locally—you just  have to consider the whole thing—you're
[00:35:18] saying transformers would work better. We’re talking about the spatial dimension.
[00:35:22] How about the temporal dimension? Right now  we're only considering the previous move because
[00:35:27] it is a deterministic full-information game. What if it were something like poker or Diplomacy,
[00:35:35] where a bluff they made a while back  is relevant to understanding now?
[00:35:40] And to decide your next move, you need  to consider all those previous states.
[00:35:44] Would that change the  consideration of what inductive
[00:35:47] bias and which architecture is most relevant? Great question. Go is a perfect information game.
[00:35:54] In perfect information games, there does  exist a Nash equilibrium strategy for which
[00:36:00] you can do no worse than any other strategy. If you know your opponent has a particular bias,
[00:36:07] like they love to play aggressively, you can  in principle counter that specific strategy
[00:36:12] better than a Nash equilibrium policy. But to counter any given strategy,
[00:36:18] there exists a single Nash equilibrium that  can be decided solely using the current state.
[00:36:25] That is a design choice AlphaGo made, which in  hindsight turned out to work very well because
[00:36:31] the Nash equilibrium seems to be superhuman. No human strategy seems to be able to beat it.
[00:36:38] There are variations of this where you  would need to consider temporal history.
[00:36:42] This is a very exciting research area, and I'd  encourage people to fork my repo and try it out.
[00:36:48] If you were to play 2v2 Go, you actually  need to model your partner's behavior.
[00:36:54] You may not have information on how they play,  so you need to aggregate information on how they
[00:36:58] play so you can respond accordingly. These are situations where it's no
[00:37:04] longer a perfect information game. In games of imperfect information
[00:37:08] or partial observability, you do  need context to build a model.
[00:37:13] That's a place where things can get very exciting  in terms of self-play or Diplomacy-style games.
[00:37:21] Returning to the neural network, the  architecture again is not super important.
[00:37:25] You can get it to work with transformers. You can get it to work with ResNets.
[00:37:27] I found that for low-budget experiments,  ResNets work a little better.
[00:37:32] You can also use Karpathy-style  AutoResearch hyperparameter
[00:37:35] tuning to make your architecture pretty good. You don't have to worry too much about that.
[00:37:40] You just need to set up the problem so  that you have a target optimization.
[00:37:46] We're going to pick a somewhat arbitrary  architecture that worked for what I did.
[00:37:50] But again, this part is not super important. You have your encoded board state and, similar
[00:38:00] to an RGB, we're going to have three channels. One channel to encode black, one to encode white,
[00:38:06] and one to encode empties or a masked region  if you want to train on multiple board sizes.
[00:38:17] I'm actually not going to talk about multiple  board sizes for now. That's a bit too
[00:38:20] complicated. We have this two- or three-channel  RGB-like image, and we feed it into a ResNet.
[00:38:33] Then we have two branching heads. One head predicts the value function,
[00:38:40] which is a single logit, let's just call it R¹. Then we have the policy, which is R³⁶¹.
[00:38:54] This is the architecture. We're going to  train this to predict the outcomes of games
[00:39:01] given the board state, and we're also going  to train it to predict what are good moves.
[00:39:06] The original AlphaGo paper, called AlphaGo  Lee, initialized this network with a
[00:39:13] supervised learning dataset of expert human play. Later, they removed this restriction by having
[00:39:18] the model teach itself how to play well. I find it super nice for implementation,
[00:39:23] for your audience, to always initialize  your experiments to something easy and get
[00:39:30] the problem working before trying to bite  off the whole thing and learn tabula rasa.
[00:39:37] In deep learning, initialization is everything. You always want to initialize your research
[00:39:43] project to something as close to success  as possible, especially if you're doing
[00:39:47] something new that you haven't done before. Always pick something that works and then
[00:39:50] get it to do something better,  rather than start from something
[00:39:52] that doesn't work at all and try to make it work. Under that philosophy, it's a great idea to start
[00:39:59] with something that has a good initialization. We're going to take human expert plays
[00:40:04] and train this model to predict good actions. We're going to take all the moves in which
[00:40:14] an expert won and predict those actions. Regardless of board state, whether you won
[00:40:20] or lost, you're going to predict the outcome. You might be wondering, for some of the early
[00:40:24] boards where only one stone  has been put down, how could
[00:40:28] you possibly know who the winner of this game is? Well, if you have hundreds of thousands of games,
[00:40:36] on average you'll probably see that boards  starting like this have half of the games
[00:40:41] branch off and win, and half branch off and  lose. So that'll actually be fine. When you
[00:40:46] train this model to predict those outcomes,  the logit will sort of converge to 0.5.
[00:40:52] For these things, it's expected that once you  train the model, a starting board state will
[00:40:57] look like 0.5, and then as you progress towards  the end of the game, the win probability will
[00:41:06] either go up or down. This is your move number.  As you get hundreds of steps into the game,
[00:41:18] it becomes much clearer who's more likely to  win or lose under your expert data distribution.
[00:41:24] I didn't understand the significance of  why this way of thinking about value is
[00:41:29] especially relevant to the expert data. It is not relevant to the expert data.
[00:41:32] It's true for any data that you trained it on. If you were to learn tabula rasa, you would also
[00:41:37] expect this to fall out. Imagine you're vibe  coding AlphaGo. You gather some expert datasets
[00:41:48] from KataGo online, or you have a dataset  of human players, and you train this model.
[00:41:54] It turns out this model is  already a pretty good Go player.
[00:41:56] It will most likely beat most human players. If you just take this policy recommendation
[00:42:02] and take the argmax over these probabilities—if  you take the argmax and just take this action
[00:42:12] as your Go play—it'll be a very fast Go player  that doesn't think in terms of reasoning steps.
[00:42:18] It just shoots from the hip, and  it'll be a very strong Go player.
[00:42:21] This is already quite miraculous if you  think about how ten neural network layers,
[00:42:26] maybe under 3 million parameters, can already  do something that impressive. You can start
[00:42:35] this way. It's important when implementing  this to verify that this is probably true.
[00:42:39] It's good to verify that your Go rules  are implemented correctly and that you
[00:42:43] can run these simulations relatively quickly. Just as a checkpoint, you want to make sure
[00:42:51] you can actually do this basic step before you  try to layer on more complex things like search.
[00:42:58] But we can do a lot better than taking the  raw neural network and playing the moves.
[00:43:05] So let’s apply the neural network  to improve Monte Carlo tree search.
[00:43:10] We start with our root node, and we now have  a four-step iterative process to do MCTS.
[00:43:24] This tripped me up when I was first reading  the paper and trying to understand it.
[00:43:29] Essentially what we're going to do is choose a  number of simulations, and this number varies.
[00:43:40] It can be somewhere between 200 and 2,048. I believe in the AlphaGo vs. Lee match,
[00:43:47] they used tens of thousands of simulations  per move because they really wanted to boost
[00:43:50] the strength of the model as much as possible. But in training, you don't actually need too many.
[00:43:55] KataGo, I think, uses something  in this order as well.
[00:43:58] Do you know if they used… If  you watch the documentary,
[00:44:00] they had a laptop out during the game. They didn't use the laptop itself. It was on some—
[00:44:04] It was on some TPU pod, I think. Honestly, kind of unfair. Lee is
[00:44:11] not using 1E22 FLOPS to do a move. Fair enough. Interestingly, modern Go
[00:44:18] bots don't need that much compute at test time. What we'll find out, as we talk about how the
[00:44:25] MCTS policy improvement works, is that  over time the raw network actually takes
[00:44:31] all of the burden of that big TPU pod  and just pushes it into the network.
[00:44:35] You can do all of that work with  one neural network forward pass.
[00:44:40] The TPU pod will always add the extra oomph on  top, and that's what they wanted for the match.
[00:44:46] We're going to pick this number of simulations  thing, and for every simulation, we're going
[00:44:51] to do several things simultaneously. We're going to see which moves are
[00:44:56] the best in the current tree. We're going to add extra leaves
[00:45:01] to the tree if we get to a point where  we need to add a leaf, and we're going
[00:45:04] to update the action values for the tree. Every simulation involves this four-step process:
[00:45:13] selection, expansion, evaluation, and backup. At the beginning of our Monte Carlo tree search,
[00:45:29] our tree is very basic. It only has the root node,
[00:45:32] or our current board that our AI wants to play at. We're basically going to select
[00:45:39] the best action for this. When this root node is created,
[00:45:43] we also know that we can evaluate it under  our neural network and get the quantities Vθ,
[00:45:50] as well as our probability over actions. And I’m going to say root.
[00:46:00] For all of the actions here, we  can create a bunch of children.
[00:46:09] In this case, I'm drawing a 3x3 board with  one missing, so there are eight possible
[00:46:15] children associated with this root node. Each of these has an associated probability
[00:46:34] of taking that action, so there's P₈, P₁, ...  P₂, and so on. So at the beginning of our Monte
[00:46:43] Carlo tree search, we have our root node,  and we can initialize it with some children.
[00:46:48] The policy network evaluated on  the root node gives us—on a 3x3
[00:46:52] board with one existing stone placed—eight  possible children that this AI could take.
[00:46:59] With each of the children, the policy network also  gives us the probability of selecting that child.
[00:47:04] The first step is to do the selection of the tree. Again, this is a very shallow tree.
[00:47:08] All we have so far is  essentially a tree of depth one.
[00:47:11] Our first move is to select by maximizing, or  argmaxing, the PUCT criterion, which is basically
[00:47:18] Q(s,a) + CPUCT x Pₐ x (√N / (1 + Nₐ)). For each of these, Nₐ is zero for all
[00:47:42] the actions initially. N is zero. So  we're going to pick according to this.
[00:47:52] Initially, the chosen action is most  likely going to be biased towards
[00:48:01] the highest-likelihood action, because  these are uniform for every node.
[00:48:07] Let's suppose P₁ was the highest-probability  node, so you selected this one here.
[00:48:13] Now you get to this node and you  realize it's not a leaf node.
[00:48:17] It's not a terminal game, so you cannot  resolve the final resolution. The next
[00:48:21] step is expansion. You will then run this  board state through the policy network.
[00:48:31] Note that this is the AI's move. The AI is making this move.
[00:48:36] When we expand this tree, we're now thinking  about what the human, or any opponent, might do.
[00:48:51] When we evaluate the node here, we're going to  evaluate it from the perspective of this player.
[00:49:00] This node has possible actions that we could  take, and we expand the leaf nodes here.
[00:49:07] For each of these nodes that we could arrive  at, we're going to now check how good they are.
[00:49:18] From here, the human could  play here, here, or here.
[00:49:23] We're going to store Vθ for each of these,  so Vθ of Node₁’, Vθ of Node₁’’, and so on.
[00:49:46] We're basically using our neural network  to make an intuitive guess of how good this
[00:49:53] board is from the perspective of this player. Fortunately, because it's a zero-sum game,
[00:49:59] it's easy to deduce that the value for  this player at this step is just one minus
[00:50:04] the value from the other perspective. It's easy to flip the search process
[00:50:08] depending on which player you're at. This is the  expansion step. You've taken a non-leaf node,
[00:50:15] expanded it, and evaluated the value. This is essentially a quick guess
[00:50:19] as to whether I'm going to win or  not if I were to play to the end.
[00:50:23] You can almost think about Vθ as a  shortcut for searching to the end
[00:50:28] of the tree, for any given simulation. This is essentially the evaluation step.
[00:50:35] We're evaluating the quality  of each of these boards.
[00:50:39] In the original AlphaGo Lee, they  did something kind of interesting.
[00:50:43] They took this value and averaged it  with the value of a real Go playout.
[00:50:49] They actually played a real game  from here all the way to the end.
[00:50:55] I'm just going to draw this  squiggly line to indicate some path.
[00:50:59] They play this all the way to  Tromp-Taylor resolution of a full board.
[00:51:06] So this is a zero or one. They took this value and
[00:51:15] averaged it with this one here. The formula was α x Vθ of some node
[00:51:25] plus (1 - α) of a truly randomly sampled playout. You might be wondering how they play this out.
[00:51:38] It would be very costly to do another search  on this playout, almost like a tree within a
[00:51:43] tree. They don't do this. Instead, they just take  the policy network and play it against itself.
[00:51:49] They use it as both players, and they  just play it all the way to the end.
[00:51:52] This helps ground the estimates here in  reality because you can get a single-sample
[00:52:00] estimate of whether you win or not. In the endgame, where the board is
[00:52:04] almost resolved, this becomes quite useful  because the play according to the policy will
[00:52:10] most likely decide a pretty reasonable guess  of the game, so you're not facing a problem
[00:52:15] where this becomes untethered from reality. It turns out this is totally unnecessary.
[00:52:20] In all subsequent papers after  AlphaGo Lee, they got rid of it.
[00:52:24] In my implementation, I did the same, and it  speeds things up a lot because you don't have to
[00:52:28] roll these games out on every single simulation. Okay, just to reinforce my own
[00:52:34] understanding and re-explain it. For the audience, by the way, in case it's not
[00:52:39] obvious, the P there in the select, that is the  probability coming from the network in this case.
[00:52:44] Correct. The policy network here. Fundamentally, a simulation, just think of it as
[00:52:54] rolling out one more node in the search process. Almost. A simulation is easy to think about
[00:53:01] when the whole tree already exists. You just walk down the tree using the
[00:53:06] PUCT selection criterion, and then you keep going. In AlphaGo, the data structure is such that we
[00:53:16] begin with a tree that basically only has depth  one—its only children—and you want to iteratively
[00:53:23] build out the tree as you're also selecting  actions down the tree. That's the core thing
[00:53:28] here. Because Go is such a combinatorially  complex game, you cannot afford to build
[00:53:32] the tree in advance and then search it. You must search while building the tree.
[00:53:38] Let me finish up with the last  step, which is the backup.
[00:53:41] Once you've scored these things, the Q value  assigned to the node here for taking this action
[00:53:50] is just the average across your evaluated values. You take a running mean over all the simulations
[00:54:01] you've taken, averaging the  values of the children nodes.
[00:54:05] That's the backup step, and once you evaluate  this, you can recursively go back up.
[00:54:09] If you know the action value of this node, you can  then take the average on its parent, and so on.
[00:54:16] You have this four-step process: 1) You're  choosing the best action you know of so far.
[00:54:21] 2) You may run into a node you haven't been to  before, so you need to grow the tree a bit. 3)
[00:54:28] You run it through the network to guess whether  you're going to win or not. 4) You walk all the
[00:54:32] way back up to the root node to update  your values on what the best moves are.
[00:54:38] As you do this iteratively, because you're  always selecting according to this criterion,
[00:54:46] you're always going to be selecting the  best action you think at any given branch.
[00:54:51] The final visit counts of how often  you chose these things will reflect
[00:54:57] your correct policy distribution as  induced through this search process.
[00:55:03] The visit count we stored in the node earlier  actually becomes the vote for which action
[00:55:08] we should finally select. As a test of understanding,
[00:55:14] it's worth thinking a little bit about  whether we could make this even simpler.
[00:55:18] Could we actually maybe even get rid of  this one and still make the thing work?
[00:55:24] Recall that when you do an expansion and then  an evaluation at this node, you are checking the
[00:55:30] win probability of each of the child nodes. So if this one is one and these are zero,
[00:55:37] you do know something about which  action might be better to take.
[00:55:42] Why would you still need this, right? Why not just normalize the values into
[00:55:48] a distribution and call that your  policy distribution? This is fine.
[00:55:53] You can do this, and it probably does work. But in practice, having a single forward pass
[00:55:59] that gives you a pretty good guess is how the  breadth is pruned out. There is a duality here.
[00:56:10] It would be weird if the policy recommended  an action that disagreed with the value.
[00:56:15] If a policy said this was very high probability,  but this one said it was a low value,
[00:56:20] then there's something fundamentally wrong  between your policy head and your value head.
[00:56:25] They are linked, and you probably could get rid  of this if you came up with a different way to
[00:56:29] recover it from just the value evaluations. Right. Just to make sure I understand, the
[00:56:36] reason you don't do that is so you don't have to  do 360 independent forward passes to say, "Okay,
[00:56:41] here's the value of everything. Let's argmax  over it." Instead, you can just do one forward
[00:56:44] pass and get the probabilities of all of them. You can usually batch these somewhat efficiently,
[00:56:52] so it probably isn't a huge  computational burden in practice.
[00:56:55] But yes, you would have to pass up to 361  boards into a single mini-batch update to
[00:57:02] evaluate all the values, then normalize them. There's actually a more important reason why
[00:57:08] we still do this, which is how Monte Carlo  tree search is used to feed back on itself
[00:57:13] and recursively improve its own  predictions and search capabilities.
[00:57:18] That's where having this as an explicit entity  you're modeling, rather than an implicit
[00:57:23] normalization over your value, is a good idea. Makes sense. Okay.
[00:57:28] We talked about the simulations. What you end up  with as you roll out the number of simulations
[00:57:33] is a tree that looks like… I'm drawing  a very low-dimensional version of this.
[00:57:41] Of course, in the real game,  it's much more high-dimensional.
[00:57:45] You'll end up with a tree structure that has a  lot of leaves that terminate and are not visited
[00:57:54] again because their value is deemed to be too low. But along one path, there will be a set of actions
[00:58:00] with very high visit counts that gravitate towards  that one set of decisions as you increase N.
[00:58:09] This is the mental picture of what the  tree in Monte Carlo tree search looks like.
[00:58:13] You should contrast this with an exhaustive tree  like in tic-tac-toe, where there are nine actions,
[00:58:20] then eight, then seven and six, and  so it's a nine-factorial-sized tree.
[00:58:26] The Monte Carlo tree search in Go is very sparse.
[00:58:29] It only considers the paths that  you've expanded children nodes on.
[00:58:36] Now that we have the search algorithm that applies  the value function as well as the policy function,
[00:58:44] we can talk about how the Monte Carlo tree  search algorithm can act as an improvement
[00:58:51] operator on top of these guys here. Twenty years ago, Jane Street's data
[00:58:55] center fit in the corner of an office. Ron Minsky, who co-leads the tech group
[00:59:00] there, told me about how it all got started. One of our compute clusters we called The Hive,
[00:59:04] and I remember the first version of the Hive  was literally like six Dell boxes stacked on
[00:59:08] top of each other at the end of the row. And the trading systems themselves we also
[00:59:12] had there because we actually wanted the ability  to make sure we could turn the damn thing off.
[00:59:17] I mean there were ups and downs, like  literally at some point you know,
[00:59:20] one of the people who was cleaning the office  unplugged one of the trading systems in the
[00:59:24] middle of the day as they were vacuuming. So, you know, in the end it is in fact
[00:59:28] better to have it all in a data center. Jane Street's data centers have come a long
[00:59:31] way since those sixth Dells, and I got to tour  one of them in Texas with Ron and Dan Pontecorvo,
[00:59:35] who leads Jane Street's physical engineering team. You know, these cabinets, these GB300 cabinets,
[00:59:40] consume at peak about 140 kW each. Compare that  to traditional air cooled, you're talking about
[00:59:45] 10 to 40 KW? It's a lot more. We got deep into the details
[00:59:49] of running one of these data centers. Things that I had never considered before.
[00:59:52] It's filled with a liquid,  a mix of deionized water
[00:59:55] and propylene glycol, 25% of propylene glycol. That’s to inhibit any bacteria or algae growth.
[01:00:02] I don't love the world where we have to  worry about bacteria growing in our servers.
[01:00:06] I got to see way more of what actually happens  in a data center than I've ever seen before.
[01:00:10] Jane Street was willing to literally pull up the  floorboards and take out the racks and take me to
[01:00:14] the back where all the chillers are. You can check all of this out at
[01:00:18] JaneStreet.com/dwarkesh where  we posted the full tour.
[01:00:23] We now talk about the RL part of how this  thing gets stronger by playing itself.
[01:00:30] Let's say we play a game. You make a  move. The AI will compute the search,
[01:00:43] and this is the visit count distribution. Let's say this is your initial policy
[01:00:49] recommendation at this node. After MCTS, it gets more
[01:00:56] confident about one of these actions. Maybe the distribution looks a bit more
[01:01:01] peaky like this based on the search. Of course, you can tune the search
[01:01:05] process so that it ends up more diffuse,  but that's probably not a good idea.
[01:01:08] MCTS should get more confident  about specific actions over others.
[01:01:12] It might place a lot of weight on other  actions initially, and then as you increase
[01:01:17] the number of sims, it should converge to a  very peaky distribution. Let's call this π.
[01:01:25] Let's wrap this in an MCTS operator of (a | s). After applying the MCTS process, your policy
[01:01:38] recommended distribution looks like this. It’s a bit more peaky than the previous one.
[01:01:43] Then you take the argmax, or  maybe you just sample from this.
[01:01:47] It doesn't have to be the argmax. You make your move, throw away the
[01:01:51] tree, and begin anew on the next move. Again, you compute a new distribution.
[01:02:08] Initially, maybe your guess looks like  this, and then you refine it through MCTS.
[01:02:16] There should be one more X on the board, right? I'm sorry, that's correct, yes. Something that
[01:02:22] looks like this. On every move, you have  your initial guess from your policy network.
[01:02:32] Then the search process, which combines  your policy network and your value network,
[01:02:35] arrives at a more confident action  that you take, and so on and so forth.
[01:02:40] Then the game ends, and one  person wins and one person loses.
[01:02:46] The beauty of how AlphaGo trains itself is  that it can actually take this final search
[01:02:53] process—the outcome of the search process—and  tell the policy network, "Hey, instead of having
[01:02:59] MCTS do all this legwork to arrive here, why  don't you just predict that from the get-go?
[01:03:04] Why don't you not use this guess  and predict this to begin with?"
[01:03:07] If you have this guess to begin with in  your policy network, then MCTS has to do
[01:03:11] a lot less work to get things to work. If we draw a test-time scaling plot…
[01:03:18] Let's say this is the number of simulations. At zero simulations, your implicit win
[01:03:26] rate is here. If you just take
[01:03:33] this raw action, this is what your win rate is. Let’s say we increase the number of sims, maybe
[01:03:39] you have a win rate curve that looks like this. When you search for 1,000 simulation steps,
[01:03:49] that gets you to a policy here that  gets you to here, which is great.
[01:03:56] But if you were to distill this MCTS policy  network back into your shoot-from-the-hip policy
[01:04:03] network, then you could actually start here. Let’s say this was zero, by distillation,
[01:04:14] if you then spend another 1,000 sim  steps, you actually get to here.
[01:04:19] It's almost as if you could amortize the first  1,000 steps into the policy network instead of
[01:04:26] the search process, then you could begin at a  much better starting point and get a much better
[01:04:30] result for the number of sims that you play. The sigmoid type nature of test-time scaling
[01:04:36] as the number of simulations increases,  the increase in win rate gets smaller.
[01:04:41] Is that true even for the distilled network? That is to say, is there some gain where we
[01:04:46] start from the distilled network  and get these early gains again,
[01:04:48] or is that just inherent to the nature of MCTS? To be honest, I actually don't know the test-time
[01:04:53] scaling behavior of MCTS simulations. I believe it might be quite sensitive to
[01:04:58] how strong this one is in practice. I'm just drawing a monotonically
[01:05:01] increasing function that gets to one. Don't pay too much attention to the
[01:05:05] shape of the curve. Just know that it's
[01:05:06] monotonic with respect to sims. The idea of MCTS is very brilliant.
[01:05:15] We got something better by applying search. Now, on our next iteration of updating this
[01:05:22] network, we're going to train it to approximate  the outcome of 1,000 steps of search.
[01:05:28] Instead of starting here, we get to have  our neural network start here, and then the
[01:05:32] play gets stronger once we then apply another  1,000 steps on top of it. You can keep going.
[01:05:37] The training algorithm for AlphaGo is to basically  take the games where you've applied the search on
[01:05:43] every move that the policy encountered—whether you  won or lost, and that's quite important—and just
[01:05:49] train the model to imitate the search process. There's an analogy to robotics,
[01:05:55] which is the DAgger algorithm. First I'm going to draw a
[01:06:00] schematic of the states: S₀, S₁, S₂, S₃. Let's say we took a series of actions in
[01:06:10] an MDP to get a trajectory. These actions may be  suboptimal. Maybe we lost at the end of this game.
[01:06:25] There is a family of algorithms that  basically take trajectories and relabel
[01:06:31] the actions to better trajectories. Maybe a better action here would
[01:06:35] have been to take A₀’. A better action here would
[01:06:39] have been A₁’, and yet another one, A₂’, A₃’. What MCTS is doing is saying: you played this
[01:06:52] game where you eventually lost, but on every  single action, I'm going to give you a strictly
[01:06:57] better action that you should have taken instead. It does not guarantee that you are going to win,
[01:07:02] but it does guarantee that if you take these  tuples as training data and retrain your policy
[01:07:10] network to predict these actions instead of  the original ones, you're going to do better.
[01:07:15] This is very related to DAgger in  robotics and imitation learning,
[01:07:19] where you want to collect an intervention here. Even if you're in a not-great state—for example,
[01:07:25] a self-driving car that veers off the  side of the road—there is still a valid
[01:07:28] action that corrects you and brings you back. Pedantic question, but is there a guarantee
[01:07:35] that MCTS must be better than the policy? For example, you could imagine early on in
[01:07:39] training, because MCTS is informed by the value  network, that when the value network hasn't been
[01:07:47] well-trained on finished games, MCTS is  worse than a randomly initialized policy.
[01:07:54] Is it just a heuristic that MCTS is better  than the policy, or is there some guarantee?
[01:07:59] In practice, it is a heuristic. It does work in practice, but let
[01:08:04] me illustrate an example where MCTS can give you  a worse distribution than your policy network.
[01:08:09] This can often happen if your self-play  algorithm has trained to a good point,
[01:08:13] but then somehow it collapses because it's  not trained on diverse data or something.
[01:08:20] Let's say we have a board state where  the policy recommendations are very good.
[01:08:25] So Πθ (a | s) is great. But somehow, maybe because we're
[01:08:33] playing a lot of games where the bots just  resign instead of playing all the way to
[01:08:37] the Tromp-Taylor resolution, they forget  how to evaluate those late-stage plans.
[01:08:43] Like in the case we showed with the corner  play, maybe 100% of our training data in
[01:08:48] our replay buffer has lost examples of how to  evaluate the value function at those states.
[01:08:54] You might end up in a scenario where  your terminal value is very bad.
[01:09:01] If the terminal values of the leaves are  not good, then this will propagate all the
[01:09:06] way up and cause your PUCT selection  criteria and your backups to be off.
[01:09:12] And then you end up visiting a very  different distribution than what
[01:09:15] your policy initially recommended. Also, if your number of sims is low,
[01:09:20] you might have a variance issue  where you just don't explore enough.
[01:09:24] It's only guaranteed to converge  when you take N to infinity.
[01:09:29] Variance in your search process  as well as inaccuracies in your
[01:09:33] evaluation can definitely screw with the  quality of your policy recommendation.
[01:09:38] That's why it's not a guaranteed improvement. That is why I suspect AlphaGo Lee had the playouts
[01:09:45] to the end in their training algorithm, so that  they could ground this thing in real playouts.
[01:09:50] In practice, what you could also do is,  for 10% of the games, prevent the bots from
[01:09:55] resigning and just say, "Resolve it to the end." That way you get some training data in your replay
[01:09:59] buffer to really resolve those late-stage playouts  that normal human players would not play to.
[01:10:09] If you assume that the  value functions are correct,
[01:10:12] this is why MCTS gives you a better policy. It's a very critical chain of assumptions.
[01:10:18] Assuming this is accurate, your search  process should give you a better
[01:10:22] recommendation than your initial guess. If you have a cold-started policy—if
[01:10:27] you have an AlphaZero-type thing—really  what's happening for the first few epochs
[01:10:31] is that the policy is kind of useless. What you're really just doing is, "Hey,
[01:10:34] let's play full games, and once we have  played full games, for the preceding moves,
[01:10:41] we'll have labeled who won and who didn't win." The loss for AlphaZero has two components:
[01:10:50] how good is the policy relative to MCTS, and  how good is the value prediction relative to
[01:10:55] who actually won the game from this move. You can think of this being applied to
[01:10:59] every single action or every single move. Really what's happening at the beginning of
[01:11:03] AlphaZero training is just that we're trying  to get the value function to actually predict
[01:11:07] who will win the game if you find yourself in  this state and you're this player. Functionally,
[01:11:14] that's all that's happening. Later on, once that's  well trained, now the policy is also improving.
[01:11:19] Correct. There’s one trick  I found to be pretty useful.
[01:11:22] This is not a peer-reviewed claim,  so take it with a grain of salt.
[01:11:26] I found it useful in my own  implementation to do the following.
[01:11:30] You want to first make sure that this is good  before you invest a lot of cycles doing MCTS.
[01:11:35] It doesn't really make a lot of sense to  do search on garbage value predictions.
[01:11:41] You want to start at a good  place where this works.
[01:11:43] AlphaGo Lee does a very good thing where it just  takes human games, you train on them, and it just
[01:11:48] works. It totally works. You can also take an  open-source Go bot, play it against itself,
[01:11:53] generate data, and that also works. If you have some offline dataset that
[01:11:59] has realistic, good play, you can easily learn  the late-stage value functions pretty well.
[01:12:07] That's what you need to start the search process. Sorry, can you just repeat that sentence one
[01:12:10] more time? Sure. It's
[01:12:12] quite easy to evaluate a late-stage Go game. When almost all the pieces are on the board,
[01:12:18] it's almost like a decidable  problem because there's lower and
[01:12:20] lower uncertainty as to the depth of the tree. So most games played to the end by reasonable
[01:12:26] people will be good training data to train a good  value function at terminal parts of the tree.
[01:12:32] Then, as you play more games,  the search will back up good
[01:12:37] values into the intermediate nodes of the tree. As you increase the amount of data, your value
[01:12:42] head gets a good intuition of what is a healthy  board state versus a not-healthy board state.
[01:12:48] Those are much more subtle to judge in the  mid-game than at the beginning or the end.
[01:12:52] The most difficult part to score is not the  beginning, because the beginning is obviously 0.5,
[01:12:57] and at the end it's pretty obvious who's winning. The hard part that you want to learn in the
[01:13:01] value function is who is winning in the middle. So this is actually very analogous to TD learning.
[01:13:06] Yes. There's a beautiful connection to TD  learning that we can talk about in a bit,
[01:13:11] contrasting it with Monte Carlo tree search. You first want to get good value functions,
[01:13:17] and expert data can give you a quick shortcut. I recommend for practitioners, just do that first
[01:13:22] to initialize to a good starting point. If you want to do the AlphaZero thing or
[01:13:26] KataGo tabula rasa learning, what you can  try to do is play random games on a small
[01:13:31] board. Just take a random agent. If you play  50,000 games, you'll actually learn a pretty
[01:13:39] good value function as well. On a 9x9 board, you can see
[01:13:43] enough of the common patterns with random play. If you train on both 9x9 and 19x19 data—and KataGo
[01:13:52] proposed one of these architectures—there's  pretty good transfer learning from the
[01:13:56] value head evaluated at 9x9 to 19x19. Right, because this, unlike other games,
[01:14:02] has very much a sense… There's not  like a new kind of piece introduced
[01:14:06] when you increase the size or something. If we take it to its limit and consider a
[01:14:10] very tiny 4x4 Go board, if you play 50,000  games, you're going to have a lot of end
[01:14:15] states that look like human play. It's just Tic-Tac-Toe at that point.
[01:14:18] If you broaden this a little bit to 5x5 or  9x9, it's not unrealistic to imagine that
[01:14:24] purely random play will generate  pretty reasonable-looking boards.
[01:14:29] You can score those pretty easily. That is what gives you the bootstrapping
[01:14:32] to then improve your policy with search. But it's very critical that MCTS has
[01:14:37] accurate value estimates. You need to ground the value.
[01:14:41] Ultimately, MCTS will fall apart if you don't  have a grounding function for the value.
[01:14:47] I'd be curious how much compute you save by  training the value and policy on the same network.
[01:14:53] Because they share the same representations,  how much more efficient is learning?
[01:14:59] We've just talked about how they're  making similar predictions, or they
[01:15:02] should be in line with each other. So I'd be curious if you're halving
[01:15:07] the amount of compute you have to do  by keeping them in the same network.
[01:15:10] AlphaGo Lee, the original AlphaGo  paper, had two separate networks.
[01:15:14] In all subsequent papers, they merged them into  two heads, and presumably this saves compute.
[01:15:19] But answering that question in  a rigorous scientific way is
[01:15:23] a simple question that in practice, if you really  want to chase the question down to its limit,
[01:15:29] takes quite a bit of work to really resolve. Intuitively, yes, they share a lot of
[01:15:34] representations. As we mentioned,
[01:15:38] your policy network and your value network,  when doing evaluations, should agree.
[01:15:43] There really should be this  consistency between them.
[01:15:46] Tell me if this is the  wrong way to think about it.
[01:15:49] When I learn how an LLM works and  how simple RLVR is as an algorithm,
[01:15:58] I'm stunned by the kinds of things it can do. It can learn how to build very complicated code
[01:16:04] repositories simply from getting a yes or no. Here, if you understand it more deeply, just
[01:16:11] predicting MCTS, AlphaGo seems less impressive  in retrospect the more you understand it.
[01:16:19] You're putting in a lot of bias by telling it how  it should titrate exploration as things go on.
[01:16:26] You're building this very  explicit tree search for it.
[01:16:30] I don't know if you share that intuition  where the more you understand it, the less
[01:16:34] impressive the accomplishment in 2017 seems. I personally disagree. I think they're
[01:16:41] profound for different reasons. I don't understand the LLM RL
[01:16:45] enough to comment on it on your podcast. But why is AlphaGo a profound accomplishment?
[01:16:53] It's worth stepping back a little bit. It is different from modern RL,
[01:16:57] and we can talk a little bit about  some of the algorithmic choices there.
[01:17:01] I think the most profound thing here is that  a 10-layer neural network pass, basically
[01:17:12] 10 steps of reasoning… Of course, the  reasoning is not just one trail of thought.
[01:17:16] It could be distributed representations and  a lot of thoughts going on at the same time.
[01:17:20] But by construction, let's say a 10-layer  neural network can only do 10 sequential
[01:17:24] steps of thinking. 10 steps of neural network  parallelized distributed-representation thinking
[01:17:31] is able to amortize and approximate to very high  fidelity a nearly intractable search problem.
[01:17:40] This was a breakthrough that I think most  people don't even fully comprehend today,
[01:17:46] how profound that accomplishment is. This is what also girds AlphaFold,
[01:17:52] for example, where you have a very, very  difficult physical simulation process where
[01:17:58] you would need to roll out as so many microscale  simulations, and yet 10 steps of a somewhat small
[01:18:04] neural network can somehow capture what feels  like an NP-class problem into a single problem.
[01:18:15] It actually makes me wonder if our  understanding of problems like P=NP,
[01:18:20] or these fundamental computational  hardness problems, is incomplete.
[01:18:26] Obviously, it's not a proof of P=NP, but  there's something to it that is very disturbing,
[01:18:34] where what felt like a very hard problem can  fall to a very simple macroscopic solution.
[01:18:40] That is a very interesting insight, that a lot of  problems which are proven to be NP-hard—I don't
[01:18:47] know if Go is proven to be NP-hard, but protein  folding, et cetera—neural networks can solve.
[01:18:54] They're NP-hard in the worst case, but we're  usually not concerned about the worst case.
[01:18:58] These problems usually have  a lot of structure to them.
[01:19:01] I think the question we should be asking ourselves  is about how we've been formulating solutions to
[01:19:08] NP-hard problems in worst-case complexity. I wouldn't say this solves Go.
[01:19:14] It doesn't give us an exact solution of the  optimum, but in practice, it is extremely useful.
[01:19:20] The same thing has been shown  in AlphaTensor and AlphaFold.
[01:19:24] Yes, there is a very hard problem that, in the  worst case, seems intractable, and yet we're able
[01:19:28] to make almost arbitrary amounts of progress. In the limit, what might this look like?
[01:19:36] If you want to simulate something very complex  like weather, or predict the future—do we live
[01:19:42] in a simulation or not—the computing resources  you need to build a very complex simulation might
[01:19:48] be much smaller than you think, based on our  ability to amortize a lot of that computation
[01:19:54] into the forward pass of a single network. To me, AlphaGo was the first paper that
[01:20:00] really showed this profound level of simulation  being compressed into a small amount of compute.
[01:20:07] I feel totally not qualified on the computational  complexity or the math to comment on this, but I
[01:20:14] wonder if there's an important role of chaos here. What is the problem with weather,
[01:20:22] and why does it take 10x the amount of  resources to predict weather a day out,
[01:20:27] and continually so for every additional day out? It's because it's a chaotic system, so small
[01:20:32] perturbations can totally change  the final estimate as time goes on.
[01:20:39] I guess you would expect that for  Go and protein folding as well.
[01:20:42] Here's an analogy to weather that might be  relevant in Go. Here's our current board state.
[01:20:55] Given what we know about both players, what  is the exact board state in the future?
[01:21:03] This is extremely sensitive to initial conditions. A single stone placed here can disrupt
[01:21:08] the entire prediction. This is hard.  Intuitively, this is the chaotic problem.
[01:21:14] Yet somehow, we can predict who's going to win. This captures a lot of possibilities.
[01:21:26] There's a more macroscopic quantity  that we really care about, which is the
[01:21:29] average or expectation or some sort of global  macrostructure over a lot of possible futures.
[01:21:37] In weather, it could be the same thing. We don't exactly care what the
[01:21:42] velocity of wind 6,000 feet above a  specific latitude and longitude is.
[01:21:48] We care where the hurricane  is, and things like that.
[01:21:52] In chaos, there's the classic Lorenz attractor. If you start anywhere on the Lorenz attractor,
[01:22:00] you don't know where you're going to end up,  but you do know that the thing looks like this.
[01:22:05] There's a kind of beauty here. Sometimes we don't necessarily
[01:22:08] care about the microscale things. We actually care about the macroscopic
[01:22:11] structure, and these things can be predictable. Contrast that to something like a hash function,
[01:22:18] which is also incredibly dependent on  initial conditions but doesn't have a
[01:22:21] macrostructure, or at least hopefully  doesn't, if the algorithms work.
[01:22:24] One would hope. There's no equivalent of
[01:22:28] a value function or broadly how the weather  is going to be that's interesting there.
[01:22:33] It's really just about what the board is going  to look like exactly 100 moves from now exactly.
[01:22:39] Intuitively, that seems correct. This is  also out of my area of expertise, but I
[01:22:46] find it interesting that the tools of cryptography  and hashing have also not been able to prove
[01:22:56] that you cannot come up with fast approximations. You cannot come up with fast approximations.
[01:23:02] If they were able to do that, then  you could prove P is not equal to NP.
[01:23:05] In fact, we know that there's  structure in many cryptographic
[01:23:08] protocols, obviously RSA cryptography. There is structure, and that structure
[01:23:12] is what quantum computers exploit to break them. Reiner has a very interesting blog post, which
[01:23:19] we've talked about in the episode, where he points  out that if you look at a high level at what
[01:23:24] cryptographic protocols look like and what neural  networks look like, they're extremely similar.
[01:23:29] You have sequential layers of  jumbling information together.
[01:23:35] There's a convergent evolution in the algorithms.
[01:23:38] In cryptography, you want the final state to  be incredibly sensitive to initial conditions,
[01:23:43] so that it comes out looking  jumbled if you change anything.
[01:23:48] In neural networks, you similarly want everything  to be dependent on all the information, because
[01:23:53] you want to process all the information  and consider how it relates to itself.
[01:23:56] You have the maximum power of a  neural network at the edge of chaos.
[01:23:59] I think there are some research papers  from Jascha Sohl-Dickstein on this.
[01:24:04] There's something quite fundamental about  chaos that's not just hopeless noise.
[01:24:05] There's something useful in chaotic  systems, at least at that boundary.
[01:24:17] But this is just thinking  about it as a philosophy.
[01:24:19] I don't know the math well  enough to comment on it.
[01:24:25] We’ll talk about LLM RL in a little bit,  because there’s some connection there,
[01:24:28] but let's go back to MCTS. What is it doing?  Crucially, it is not saying that we're going to
[01:24:36] increase the probability of winning directly. It's not going to upweight all actions that won
[01:24:42] and downweight all actions that didn't win. Importantly, what it is doing is saying:
[01:24:47] for every action we took, we did a pretty  exhaustive search on MCTS to see if we could
[01:24:54] do better, and we're going to make every  action that we took better by having the
[01:24:58] policy network predict that outcome instead. This is a very nice idea because you have one
[01:25:04] supervision target for every single action. The variance of your learning signal is very
[01:25:10] low compared to the alternative naive RL thing. Let's consider a very naive algorithm that looks
[01:25:18] a lot more like modern LLM RL today, where we  do something like take the winner of a self-play
[01:25:25] game and encourage it to do more of that. It's worth thinking a little bit about what
[01:25:31] alternatives we could use to train  self-play agents instead of MCTS.
[01:25:35] We use a lot of LLM-style RL these days. Is that  relevant? Could we do that instead? Suppose we
[01:25:44] have a very naive algorithm where we  take a league of agents of different
[01:25:48] checkpoints and play them against each other. For the games where a single player wins,
[01:25:54] we reinforce those actions up and retrain  the policy network to imitate those winners,
[01:26:01] instead of the MCTS objective. Let's say you have a chain of
[01:26:10] actions that led to a win, and you have a matchup  between two agents that are basically the same.
[01:26:19] Assume policy a (Πₐ) and policy b (Πb) are  evenly matched, so their true win rate is 50%.
[01:26:34] Let's say you play 100 games,  and each game lasts 300 moves.
[01:26:47] You're doing some sort of evolution  strategy or some way to perturb these
[01:26:52] things to get them to do different things. Or maybe you don't, and you just play them
[01:26:55] against each other to see that occasionally one  might have a better strategy than the other.
[01:27:00] Let's say policy a wins 51  games and policy b wins 49.
[01:27:13] This is just due to random luck,  or maybe you perturbed policy a
[01:27:16] in some way that let it do this. Just to have a very simple model,
[01:27:19] let's pretend that for 50 of the  games, they played exactly equally.
[01:27:34] In the one game where a won,  it played slightly differently.
[01:27:37] It made one critical move that normally it  would have done differently, but due to some
[01:27:42] exploration or random noise, it happened to  make a smarter move than it did previously.
[01:27:46] So you have one true supervision signal for  your policy network, and then you have 99 games
[01:27:58] times 300 moves for which imitating those actions  gives you exactly the same policy you had before.
[01:28:07] The scale of your variance is actually very  bad, because you only have one label out of
[01:28:12] this enormous dataset of supervision actions where  you want… Actually, let me clarify a little bit.
[01:28:20] We're talking about how the good move, the  out-of-distribution move, is a small fraction
[01:28:24] of all the moves that are played across  all the games on which you'd want to train.
[01:28:29] This, of course, reminds me of how LLMs  are trained with policy gradient methods.
[01:28:36] When Karpathy was on the podcast, he called  it like "sucking supervision through a straw".
[01:28:42] It's interesting that this thing you're  saying—which would be intractable and prevents
[01:28:45] you from actually getting beyond a certain level  in Go—is just by default how LLMs are trained?
[01:28:51] Right. This is not to say it doesn't work. If you imagine increasing the number of games
[01:28:57] to millions of samples, you actually can  get some meaningful supervision samples,
[01:29:03] so long as you find a way to mask  out the supervision from these guys.
[01:29:08] This is where things start to get pretty related  to RL in terms of advantage and baselines.
[01:29:14] Let's look at the gradient variance  of a very naive approach—I'm going
[01:29:21] to call it gradient RL—that's  basically the sum of rewards.
[01:29:52] The sum of rewards is the return. In our naive setup here,
[01:29:56] we only have an indicator variable for  the return, where either you won or lost.
[01:30:05] In the case where you lost, your gradient is  zero, so you don't train on those examples,
[01:30:10] and when you won, you try to predict those things.
[01:30:13] You can think about this setup as a  special case of this general formula here.
[01:30:20] The trouble here is that  this is very high variance.
[01:30:24] When you multiply these terms out to  compute the variance of the gradient,
[01:30:34] it's equal to the expectation of… Just for  simplicity, we can pretend this is on average zero
[01:30:45] or something if you're centering it at no signal. The variance here basically means that you're
[01:30:53] taking the square of this product term. You end up with
[01:30:58] a term that grows quadratically with T. When you have a setup like this, this thing acts
[01:31:08] as a coupling effect on top of these terms here. Let's actually map this to an LLM case,
[01:31:17] and we can answer why LLMs only do one-step  RL instead of a multi-step RL scenario.
[01:31:25] In LLMs, you have a decoder that might  predict some words like "hello world".
[01:31:34] In current LLM RL, they treat this entire sequence  as a single action, aₜ, and big T is just one.
[01:31:44] It's true that because of how transformers are  formulated through the product of conditional
[01:31:51] probabilities, the log probability of the  whole sequence is equal to the sum of the
[01:32:03] probabilities of individual tokens. In this case, I would say something
[01:32:10] like log(hel) + log(lo) + log(world). This is true, and if this term were one,
[01:32:27] then they would be the same thing. However, when you're sampling, if you
[01:32:32] have a reward term assigned to every specific  token, now you have these interaction effects
[01:32:39] between the cross-multiplication  of these terms and these terms.
[01:32:43] The problem becomes, how do you  ascribe the credit associated with
[01:32:47] every episode to all these different terms? The thing I'm confused on is what it would
[01:32:52] even look like to do it that way in LLMs, because  you only get a reward at the end of the episode.
[01:33:01] You could imagine a reward that says, "I'm going  to give you some process supervision where you get
[01:33:07] a reward for each of these actions on every step." Okay, so you're saying if instead of doing it
[01:33:13] that way… Well, the way you've written  it, it would be a sum at the end anyway,
[01:33:18] so they wouldn't have to be multiplied. But you're saying instead of doing it
[01:33:22] that way, you would just add up these  process rewards at the end and then
[01:33:26] treat that as one single reward signal? Correct, for one single log prob action.
[01:33:29] But isn't that how it's written to begin  with anyways? The sum of the rewards?
[01:33:36] The thing that's a little bit hidden here in  the math is that we’re assuming that when you
[01:33:39] decompose the problem into a multi-step problem,  you're now introducing correlations between your
[01:33:45] actions through the computation of this guy. If you separate these things out,
[01:33:52] this will magnify the variance of this one. In the case where you don't separate it out,
[01:33:57] if you just have T=1, you have a single estimate  of log prob and a single estimate of reward. This
[01:34:07] term still shows up. In LLMs, the naive REINFORCE  estimator looks a bit like the return of the
[01:34:15] single action… It looks kind of like this. This is the basic form here, but it's still
[01:34:30] a contributor to variance. You want to make sure that,
[01:34:35] similar to how in this case we were training  on a lot of neutral labels, you're sort of
[01:34:41] penalizing the labels that don't help and only  rewarding the ones that actually make you better.
[01:34:47] Intuitively, the analogy is: can we find  a term in our training objective such that
[01:34:52] it’s actually discouraged from doing this, or  these don't have any effect on the gradient,
[01:34:58] and this has an effect on the gradient? If you applied that there, the only thing
[01:35:03] you could do is eliminate 49 of the games. At least the way you have it written there,
[01:35:11] it would be 51 times… Actually, the optimal case is to discard
[01:35:17] all of these moves, and only get a gradient  on that single move that you got better on.
[01:35:23] How would you do that? This is a pretty tricky problem in practice.
[01:35:28] This is where advantage estimation  happens in reinforcement learning.
[01:35:32] You want to subtract a term from your multiplier. Instead of an indicator function of one and zero,
[01:35:46] you want something that behaves like a zero for  all of these guys, and then a one for these ones.
[01:35:52] You could do that if you can say, "Hey,  I won this game, so this is slightly
[01:35:58] above baseline performance." Well, you won a lot of games.
[01:36:03] But you don't know which ones let you win because  they were truly better versus winning by accident.
[01:36:07] How would you design a baseline  where it's truly better?
[01:36:10] This is where in RL people use things like  TD learning to better approximate the quality
[01:36:16] function, the Q that we mentioned earlier. You can try to subtract that from your return.
[01:36:23] Ideally, what you really want to do in RL  is push up the actions that make you better
[01:36:30] than average and push down the actions that  make you worse than average. They call this
[01:36:36] advantage. There are multiple ways to compute it. I highly recommend John Schulman's "Generalized
[01:36:41] Advantage Estimation" paper as a good treatment  on how to think about various ways to compute it.
[01:36:49] At the end of the day, you want to reduce  variance by trying to make this smaller,
[01:36:54] so it doesn't magnify the variance of this one. That makes sense. This requires you to have
[01:36:59] a very good estimate of what average  performance from a state would look like.
[01:37:03] This gets us back to the value function  thing we were talking about earlier.
[01:37:08] Keep in mind that this model-free RL setting  is trying to solve a credit assignment problem
[01:37:14] where you don't know which actions were  actually good and which ones were bad.
[01:37:18] Monte Carlo tree search is doing  something very fundamentally different.
[01:37:20] It's not trying to do credit assignment on wins.
[01:37:24] It's trying to improve the label  for any given action you took.
[01:37:30] We can actually think about a completely different  algorithm called neural fictitious self-play,
[01:37:34] which was used to great effect in  systems like AlphaStar and OpenAI's Dota.
[01:37:41] Let me talk a little bit about how you can unify  some of these RL ideas in the model-free setting
[01:37:47] as well as the self-play setting. What happens if you don't have
[01:37:53] the ability to easily search a tree? In Go, it's a perfectly observable game.
[01:37:58] You can easily construct a pretty deep tree  that completely captures the game state.
[01:38:02] In a game like StarCraft where you don't  have complete control over the binary,
[01:38:06] it's a little bit hard to do this, and I'm  not even sure if it's a deterministic game.
[01:38:11] That makes this difficult from  a data structures perspective.
[01:38:16] What is done instead is that the  basic idea of supervising your
[01:38:22] actions with a better teacher is still there. We’re going to talk a little bit about how neural
[01:38:30] fictitious self-play works. It's the same idea.  We're going to come up with better labels for
[01:38:44] each of the actions we took, just like in MCTS. But how do we derive the better labels? In MCTS,
[01:38:57] we perform search. Assuming we have a good  value function, the search will give us
[01:39:02] a better result than our initial guess. In a game where you can't easily simulate
[01:39:08] a search process, what they do instead is  train what's known as a best response policy.
[01:39:18] You fix your opponent. Let's say you're currently  training Πₐ against a strong opponent, Πb.
[01:39:28] In StarCraft, maybe these are the Zergs  and you're playing Protoss or something.
[01:39:34] You fix your opponent, and you treat this  as a classic model-free RL algorithm,
[01:39:39] where your goal is just to beat this guy. Here you use your standard TD-learning-style
[01:39:44] tricks, or use PPO or any  model-free RL algorithm to
[01:39:49] try to hill climb to winning against this player. You have a reward function where the return is one
[01:40:02] if it wins against Πb, and zero otherwise. This is no longer a self-play problem.
[01:40:09] It's just a fixed opponent, and you're  trying to maximize a score against them.
[01:40:19] You have a fixed environment where all  you care about is beating this guy.
[01:40:25] Once you have a good policy that you train  with your favorite model-free RL algorithm—PPO
[01:40:31] or SAC or V-MPO—you now have a good policy  that gives you a good label for what this
[01:40:40] one should do when playing against that player. When you train multiple best response policies,
[01:40:46] you can basically distill the RL algorithms  into the labels for a given opponent.
[01:40:52] You might have a best response policy  against πb, and then maybe you have
[01:40:55] a league of opponents like πb, πc, πd. You're going to take the best response
[01:41:04] policy that you train against each of  these fixed opponents, and supervise
[01:41:09] them with the label that this one would provide. This is almost like a proxy for your MCTS teacher.
[01:41:16] Instead of an MCTS teacher, you use a model-free  RL algorithm to find the best search action
[01:41:22] that you could do to beat your opponent. Then you're distilling the policy here
[01:41:29] into what's known as a mixed strategy,  where it's trying to average across all
[01:41:34] possible opponents you could play against. This is what gives you something that
[01:41:37] can do no worse than an averagely  selected opponent from the league.
[01:41:43] This gets around the problem of having to derive  a teaching signal from MCTS, but fundamentally
[01:41:48] it's still about relabeling your states with  better actions so that they improve your policy.
[01:41:54] Just to make sure I understand, if you  win a game against this other policy,
[01:41:59] you reinforce all the actions on that trajectory. Yes. Here you can use a number of algorithms like
[01:42:05] PPO, V-MPO, or even Q-learning if you want. The specific algorithm here is usually a
[01:42:15] model-free thing because you don't have search,  but there's an interesting connection between
[01:42:19] MCTS and Q-learning that I want to bring up. In MCTS, you have a tree, and through the
[01:42:30] resolution of your value function at  the approximate leaves of the tree,
[01:42:36] you can back up through many sequences and  obtain some sort of mean value estimate.
[01:42:44] Your Q is derived from the  average of a bunch of simulations.
[01:42:49] In model-free algorithms, there's often  a component of estimating a Q value.
[01:42:58] Q values are often learned through  TD learning, although in PPO,
[01:43:01] the way they do advantage estimation is  not necessarily through a Bellman backup.
[01:43:05] In Q-learning, there's this very cool trick where  Q(s,a) is backed up as r plus some discount factor
[01:43:19] times the max over a, Q of your next step. Intuitively, if you have an MDP and this is
[01:43:33] terminal, it's saying that the best action  you can take at this state is equal to the
[01:43:46] reward you get for taking this action, plus  the best that you can do at the next state.
[01:43:52] There's a recursive, dynamic-programming  property of MDPs, and you can train neural
[01:43:57] networks to basically enforce this consistency. You can say, "Well, once I know the Q value of
[01:44:04] this action, I can then use that to compute  something about the Q value for the next."
[01:44:09] Earlier I was like, "Hey,  why are we training policy?
[01:44:11] Why don't we just train the value  alone?" That is what this is.
[01:44:15] This is an algorithm for recovering value  estimates of intermediate steps when you
[01:44:20] don't have the ability to do forward search. You must collect a trajectory first of n steps
[01:44:27] before you're able to do this trick. But the intuition is kind of the same.
[01:44:32] Knowing something about the Q value here can  tell you something about the Q value here.
[01:44:36] And indeed, you can recover  a policy from a Q value.
[01:44:40] You don't need to explicitly  model the policy distribution.
[01:44:43] You can recover the policy distribution  by doing argmax over your Q values.
[01:44:50] Q-learning, or approximate dynamic  programming, propagates what you
[01:44:56] know about the future Qs backward like this. You can see that there's a similar structure
[01:45:01] going on here, where in one case you're planning  over trajectories your agent hasn't been to yet,
[01:45:07] whereas in the other you're planning  over trajectories your agent has visited.
[01:45:13] Importantly, why was Q-learning a big deal? It's because historically we just haven't had the
[01:45:19] ability to do search on fairly high-dimensional  problems like robotics or whatever.
[01:45:24] For a long time, we made the assumption that if  we can't model the dynamics with a world model,
[01:45:30] we're going to instead just  collect trajectories and then
[01:45:32] plan with respect to the only number  that really matters, which is reward.
[01:45:36] This is very interesting. To unify this with  our discussion of LLMs, you don't have Q values,
[01:45:44] but you're doing this backwards learning  where you find the trajectories that pass
[01:45:50] some unit test in some coding environment  and then reinforce those trajectories.
[01:45:54] There's a huge difference between that  and this forward approach with MCTS.
[01:45:59] The reason it's much more preferable to do MCTS is  because you can do it per move and make each move
[01:46:05] better, rather than having to learn per trajectory  and hope, as Karpathy said, to learn this…
[01:46:11] Through a straw. Right, you get supervision through a straw.
[01:46:14] You basically just upgrade all the tokens in  a trajectory that might or might not have been
[01:46:17] relevant to getting the answer right. The reason you can do this much more
[01:46:21] sample-efficient, favorable thing with Go is  that because MCTS works in Go, you basically
[01:46:30] know that if you just do the search locally  here—and this search is truncated at the end
[01:46:36] by a value function that works even if you haven't  unfolded your whole trajectory—you can just say,
[01:46:43] "This is my new policy," and improve in  a more iterative, local way, rather than
[01:46:50] having to unfold all these trajectories. There was some research from Google in
[01:46:57] 2023 or 2024 where they tried to  apply tree structures to reasoning.
[01:47:04] The jury is still out as to  whether this can ever work.
[01:47:11] We probably will see a revisiting of this  idea of forward search in the future.
[01:47:18] But there are two things that make MCTS very  simple for Go. Value estimation is concrete.
[01:47:24] You can determine it for real, and then you can  use it to truncate depth, as you said. The breadth
[01:47:31] is also determined. What's critical is that the  action selection algorithm, where you iteratively
[01:47:37] visit and grow the tree, is well suited for  the size and depth of problem that Go is.
[01:47:45] But for something like LLM reasoning,  PUCT might not be a good enough heuristic.
[01:47:49] It might be too greedy with local tokens, and  it might only give you obvious thoughts that are
[01:47:57] correct but don't really solve your final problem. I would say the jury is probably still out
[01:48:02] on what the final instantiation of  reasoning for LLMs will look like.
[01:48:06] I wouldn't rule out that this stuff  could come back, but it's a bit hard.
[01:48:09] Don't LLMs natively learn to do MCTS, where  they'll try an approach and be like, "Oh,
[01:48:16] that doesn't work. Let's back up. Let's  try this other thing," and then go in the
[01:48:20] direction that proves to be more fruitful? Certainly, LLMs manage to do something that
[01:48:25] looks like real human reasoning without  having to do an explicit tree structure.
[01:48:30] That being said, I think the idea of doing forward  search and simulation to get a better sense of
[01:48:35] what is valuable might make a comeback, even if  not in exactly the same instantiation as AlphaGo.
[01:48:43] Just to make sure I understand the crux of it:  the breadth comes from the number of legal actions
[01:48:50] being wider, and the depth comes from not being  able to train a value function as easily, because…
[01:48:57] Here's an example where LLMs break down. The CPUCT rule involves the √N over 1+Nₐ.
[01:49:03] In an LLM, you're most likely never going  to sample the same child more than once.
[01:49:10] If you have multiple steps of thinking,  because language is so broad and open-ended, a
[01:49:17] discrete set of actions is not really  an appropriate choice for an LLM.
[01:49:21] Even though they're discrete tokens, it's  just such a large number that this type
[01:49:25] of exploration heuristic is probably not the  right thing to guide how to search down a tree.
[01:49:31] I guess the crux comes down to the fact that  in Go, you know that MCTS is almost certainly
[01:49:38] better than your current policy, even though  you haven't explored the end of any trajectory.
[01:49:45] In normal reasoning for LLMs or robotics,  there's no way to just locally evaluate
[01:49:50] and improve your next move in a way that's  independent of actually solving the problem.
[01:49:58] "No way" is a strong word. Lots of people have thought
[01:50:00] about how to apply MCTS or its successors  like MuZero to continuous control spaces,
[01:50:06] and I'm sure very cool research work is  still ongoing to try to crack that problem.
[01:50:11] But yes, the apparent challenge right now is  that most problems in much higher-dimensional
[01:50:19] action spaces, or something combinatorially much  bigger like language, don't seem as amenable
[01:50:25] to the discrete action-selection heuristics  and game-evaluation type stuff that Go has.
[01:50:33] That's not to say the idea of  thinking into the future along
[01:50:37] multiple parallel tracks might not give you  some information about which way to search.
[01:50:41] If you think about mathematics, it often occupies  more of a logical search procedure where you can
[01:50:48] back up and see which paths seem good or not. There's more of a rigid structure there,
[01:50:53] whereas in a business negotiation it's less  of a tree and maybe something a bit different.
[01:51:03] We're now seated, so I can ask  you some more questions about
[01:51:05] AlphaGo and AI research more generally. In 2021, Andy Jones had a paper called
[01:51:12] "Scaling Scaling Laws with Board Games", and  he basically anticipated inference compute,
[01:51:17] or inference scaling, by showing that you can  trade off test-time compute and training compute.
[01:51:22] That is to say, you can spend more compute  searching through MCTS, and if you do that,
[01:51:28] you can get the equivalent performance to  having spent more time training the model.
[01:51:34] If you see this pattern, you might think that with  LLMs you might do something similar in the future,
[01:51:38] and in fact that's what ended up happening. What is a fun exploration one could do now to
[01:51:46] explore other axes of scaling in toy settings,  which will be important to understanding what
[01:51:52] AI development might be like in a few years? Test-time scaling and reasoning, and how they
[01:52:01] interact with model size, are quite profound when  it comes to how much needs to actually be done as
[01:52:08] explicit search versus how much can be packed  into the forward pass of a neural network.
[01:52:14] How does a forward pass of a neural network learn  to do something that should be sequential and
[01:52:20] recursive? That's quite interesting. The Andy  Jones "Scaling Scaling Laws with Board Games"
[01:52:24] paper is quite cool. There was another
[01:52:26] really nice result from that paper. Not only can you predict scaling laws of
[01:52:32] the LLM variety—where as you increase parameters  you can decrease the amount of compute for search
[01:52:38] or vice versa—but he also showed that you can  predict how much compute is needed to solve a
[01:52:45] larger version of the board game. For example with Go, which can scale from
[01:52:51] 3x3 to an infinitely sized Go board, you  might be able to revisit this question and
[01:52:57] try to reproduce whether this shows up. I actually started this project with the
[01:53:02] motivation of asking: does the "Bitter Lesson",  or our knowledge of scaling laws, allow us to
[01:53:06] execute a lot better on a compute-optimal Go bot? Can we build a strong Go bot without all of the
[01:53:12] KataGo tricks, just by really focusing  on the Bitter Lesson and scaling laws?
[01:53:16] I have not been successful so far, but usually  when you want scaling laws to work, you want
[01:53:23] to be in the regime where the recipe already  works and the data sets are good, rather than
[01:53:28] trying to figure out how to do scaling while also  trying to figure out what the right data sets are.
[01:53:34] The scientific understanding component  in research often follows a step where
[01:53:38] you get something to work first. Then you use that system to collect
[01:53:43] data that then helps you build a mental model  of how things work, such as scaling laws.
[01:53:47] Usually, if you want to build a strong Go bot  using scaling laws, you actually have to make
[01:53:51] a strong Go bot first and then use the scaling  laws to extrapolate a bit further into the future.
[01:53:56] Say more. Just so I understand, are  you saying scaling laws did not work?
[01:54:01] There was no scaling-laws pattern  that you could see in your Go bot?
[01:54:05] A mistake I made initially, when I had some  bugs around how MCTS labeling was working,
[01:54:09] was that I would collect a bunch of data  with an expert policy and then treat it
[01:54:14] as a supervised learning problem and try to  identify scaling laws with expert data sets.
[01:54:19] You can indeed plot things that look like  this, but if you're in a regime where
[01:54:24] your policy is not working well, you might  just be studying scaling laws on bad data.
[01:54:29] One important implementation detail is that  if you want to study a scaling-laws problem,
[01:54:33] you have to have a problem for which the data  is good, the architecture is good, and there
[01:54:38] are no bugs, and then you solve it from there. Ex ante, I wasn't able to apply scaling laws
[01:54:44] to direct what to look at until I had the rest  of the system working. This sounds obvious to
[01:54:51] researchers. Of course you want a working,  bug-free system before you study scaling.
[01:54:55] But as advice for practitioners, on where  I tripped up when I started this project,
[01:55:00] you don't necessarily want to jump into  the science of studying your man-made
[01:55:04] artifact before your man-made artifact  is interesting enough to be studied.
[01:55:08] Speaking of compute, you can look at these charts  of compute used to train the best AI model in the
[01:55:16] world over time going back 10 years. It's a very smooth line in log space
[01:55:22] that grows exponentially year over year. Except there's this huge aberration, and that
[01:55:27] aberration is AlphaGo Zero, which was trained  on way more compute than any other AI model at
[01:55:33] the time. It was 3E23 FLOPS. It's comparable to a  frontier LLM, orders of magnitude off, but still.
[01:55:44] The question is, especially with  you being able to get something
[01:55:47] off the ground, did you train it on your own? I got a donation from Prime
[01:55:50] Intellect for about $10K. I spent maybe the first $4K doing exploratory
[01:55:58] research, and then about $3K on the final run. Some of it remained for serving the model.
[01:56:06] Is your sense that they did a bad job  training it, if you can do it in $10K now?
[01:56:11] The compute required to be the first  to do something is always much larger
[01:56:15] than the compute it takes to catch up. It's the same story playing out in LLMs.
[01:56:18] Once someone else has done it, you  can use tricks like distillation.
[01:56:22] You can use all sorts of crutches  to bootstrap your way to success.
[01:56:27] With my own bot that I've hosted online,  I actually used best-response training
[01:56:32] against the KataGo models to get  a strong level of performance.
[01:56:37] As of the time of recording, I'm validating  whether I can do that first step, which is
[01:56:42] to do the tabula rasa play. Importantly for research,
[01:56:45] you often want to start from a good init. The simple thing I did first was train
[01:56:48] best-response agents against KataGo. The AlphaZero team did not have any
[01:56:54] policy they could train against, because they  were trying to do everything tabula rasa.
[01:56:58] Being the first to do it means you're prioritizing  getting the thing working rather than the most
[01:57:02] compute-efficient possible implementation. This plays out in robotics as well.
[01:57:07] If you look at the frontier of large models  trained for robotics, the scatter plot is
[01:57:12] all over the place, and there isn't a very  clean line the way there is for frontier LLMs.
[01:57:17] That's because the folks training  these models often are not at the
[01:57:22] scale where every FLOP counts and they need  to squeeze out the performance of every single
[01:57:27] FLOP as the deciding factor in pre-training. Instead, their focus is more, "We want a certain
[01:57:33] capability to show up, so we optimize the training  setup to make it easy to derive that capability."
[01:57:39] Once you have that capability… Invariably if you  scale up the compute, you are forced to make it
[01:57:44] compute-efficient, because this is hundreds  of millions of dollars we're talking about.
[01:57:48] But in the past, when compute for experiments was  more plentiful—or not accounted for in a way the
[01:57:57] researcher was really responsible for—you end up  with people optimizing for things besides being on
[01:58:01] the compute-optimal Pareto frontier. I see, like speed or something?
[01:58:04] Yeah, time to result, or just getting it to work. The first AlphaGo probably had lots of compute,
[01:58:10] and they didn't need to worry too much about  making it the most compute-optimal thing.
[01:58:15] How much of the improvements to compute  efficiency are methods that did not exist
[01:58:19] as of 2017 versus things which they  could have done in 2017 but didn't?
[01:58:24] Great question. Going into this project,  I knew in the back of my mind that things
[01:58:28] always get easier to do over time. I wanted to see where Go was at,
[01:58:32] given that there hadn't seemed to be any major  open-source strong bot after KataGo in 2020.
[01:58:39] Reading the KataGo paper, there  were a lot of clever ideas.
[01:58:42] I was thinking, "Let’s see if the Bitter Lesson  had happened, where a lot of these tricks just go
[01:58:48] away because Nvidia made faster GPUs. Roughly, where are we on that?"
[01:58:53] Again, this is not a peer-reviewed claim. It's just my preliminary vibe guess based on
[01:58:59] what I’ve seen with my own experiments. It seems like architecture choices
[01:59:05] don't matter that much. Transformer versus ResNet…
[01:59:09] We're at the speed of GPU where the size of the  model is not so big that this really matters.
[01:59:15] You can simplify the setup quite a lot. Instead of doing a distributed asynchronous
[01:59:20] RL setup with replay buffers and pushers and  collectors, you can do a dumb synchronous thing
[01:59:25] where you collect, train a supervised  learning model, and then collect again.
[01:59:30] There are opportunities to  simplify infrastructure.
[01:59:33] Nvidia GPUs have indeed gotten faster. Whereas KataGo was trained on V100s,
[01:59:37] you can train on half the number of  desktop Blackwell GPUs and it still works.
[01:59:45] Some of the auxiliary supervision objectives  that KataGo developed aren't really necessary
[01:59:50] if you have a strong initialization. If you're initializing best-response
[01:59:55] training against KataGo itself, your own model  needs none of the tricks that KataGo needs.
[02:00:00] The core thing is getting as quickly  as possible to some strong opponents.
[02:00:05] That matters a lot more than the  specific architectural innovations.
[02:00:08] But there are still some nice compute multipliers.
[02:00:11] I found that training on 9x9 boards was very  nice for resolving endgame value functions.
[02:00:16] If you can co-train that on an architecture  that can transfer between 9x9 and 19x19,
[02:00:21] you can really cut down the  warm-start time to learn from scratch.
[02:00:25] AlphaGo Zero's plot showed the first 30  hours or so spent basically catching up
[02:00:29] to the supervised learning baseline. You can cut down that time a lot
[02:00:34] by pre-training on a small board and then  warm-starting that into your 19x19 board play.
[02:00:42] There was some other stuff, like varying  the number of sims between episodes.
[02:00:46] This turns out to be not that sensitive. You can fix it or increase it. It doesn't
[02:00:52] matter too much. Anyway, it's nice from a  scientific perspective, revisiting an old
[02:00:57] paper and seeing what really matters. This is a tangential question,
[02:01:00] but why is it okay to have a buffer in AlphaGo? Every time I talk to an AI researcher, they're
[02:01:05] telling me about how bad it is to be off-policy. But the way a naive implementation of AlphaGo Zero
[02:01:10] would work is that most of the moves in a given  backward step, or in a batch of backward steps,
[02:01:18] would not be among the ones made by the most  recently trained model. So why is that okay?
[02:01:26] Great question. This gets into the  fundamental off-policy versus on-policy
[02:01:32] reinforcement learning questions. As you'll recall, in MCTS, you take
[02:01:37] actions that you took, and you relabel them  to take different actions on the same states.
[02:01:44] The off-policy part comes in where, what if  you're relabeling states that your new policy
[02:01:49] would never visit? What's the point? You're  wasting capacity. In the extreme limit, imagine
[02:01:54] the distribution of states in your training  buffer are all states you would never visit.
[02:01:58] Then you're supervising them to take good  actions on states you would never achieve.
[02:02:05] Therefore, your policy can get really bad. This is where off-policy can really hurt AlphaGo.
[02:02:12] However, if you interpret this from the DAgger  perspective—which is basically a way to correct
[02:02:17] yourself back to the optimal trajectory given  some data—what you want in an algorithm like
[02:02:24] this is to have mostly states that you would  visit, but then a small or reasonable percentage
[02:02:30] of states in this high-dimensional  tube around your optimal trajectories.
[02:02:36] Any of those states are given a supervision target  to funnel you back into your optimal trajectory.
[02:02:43] Maybe I can just draw real quickly here. In a DAgger-style setup, your optimal
[02:02:50] training data distribution is  your optimal states and actions.
[02:02:56] You want to be in this state, you want  to be in this state, you want to be
[02:02:59] in this state, and then you win here. These are your optimal policy actions.
[02:03:05] These are the things you  definitely want to train on.
[02:03:08] But to make it robust to disturbances, you  want to make sure that if you happen to
[02:03:12] drift off into some other states,  you can funnel yourself back in.
[02:03:17] But why isn't this a fully general  argument for off-policy training?
[02:03:20] This is actually why you want to  do off-policy training sometimes.
[02:03:24] You don't want a compounding error where, if  you make a mistake, you don't have the data
[02:03:28] for how to return to your optimal distribution. Optimal control doesn't really say too much about
[02:03:37] how to not accidentally get here, because it's  making the assumption that once you learn the
[02:03:42] policy, you're going to get to here. But in applications like robotics,
[02:03:47] a gust of wind blows you slightly  off and now you need to correct.
[02:03:51] Or the friction on one of your tires is slightly  lower than the other wheel, and now your car is
[02:03:55] drifting and you have to correct it. These kinds of things often happen in
[02:03:59] more real environments. There was a funny quote about chess and Go.
[02:04:07] The problem with Go and chess is that the  other player is always trying to do some shit.
[02:04:12] Things can drift off, and you always want to be  able to correct back to your winning condition.
[02:04:19] Your replay buffer really should have the  states your policy would visit, plus some
[02:04:25] distribution of states you might drift to, and  then how to return back to your optimal states.
[02:04:31] Now, if you take this to the extreme and  you say, "We don't have any of this data,
[02:04:41] and we're just going to be labeling with MCTS  states that are so far away from our optimal
[02:04:49] behavior, like this bag of states over here…"  Well, now each of them gets an MCTS label,
[02:04:58] and your policy learns how to take the best  possible action here, but you never get here.
[02:05:02] You're training your model on  states you would never reach.
[02:05:09] This is where off-policy can really hurt. As part of this project, I did try an experiment
[02:05:15] where I took a bunch of trajectories, and to  try to saturate the GPU as much as possible,
[02:05:21] I took random states from the dataset  and reran MCTS on just those states.
[02:05:28] Instead of playing a whole game where I'm doing  MCTS on every move, I ignore the causality of
[02:05:33] moves and pick random board states, and  I label those with my current network.
[02:05:38] I might revisit old states I've labeled before  and relabel them again with my current network.
[02:05:43] In practice, this actually does work. You can take some states that are reasonable and
[02:05:49] constantly be relabeling them while training. This starts to converge on a very
[02:05:56] robotics-like setup, which is very common. You have your dataset of trajectories, and then
[02:06:02] you have something like a replay buffer pusher.  These are off-policy offline trajectories. Your
[02:06:13] replay buffer pusher pushes transition tuples to  the replay buffer, and then you have a job that's
[02:06:27] continuously replanning what the best action you  should have done instead of the action you took.
[02:06:37] In robotics, it's very  common to minimize TD error.
[02:06:41] Your Bellman updater is constantly pulling  things from here and trying to satisfy Q(s,a).
[02:07:01] From here you have your trainer, which  is trying to fit the Q to the Qᵗᵃʳᵍᵉᵗ.
[02:07:12] You can think about this as a sort of planner. You visit old states you've been to,
[02:07:17] and you take your current model and rethink. What could I have done better if I visited this?
[02:07:25] This is how off-policy robotic  learning systems are usually trained.
[02:07:29] These days there's a simpler recipe, but in the  Google QT-Opt days, we did things like this.
[02:07:35] So what is the trainer? The trainer is where you try
[02:07:39] to minimize Q(s,a) and Qᵗᵃʳᵍᵉᵗ. Can you explain the whole setup
[02:07:47] again at a high level? You have your off-policy
[02:07:50] data that came from various policies. You're constantly pushing transitions
[02:07:54] you saw before to a replay buffer. Then you've got this thing called
[02:07:58] a Bellman updater, which basically replans:  instead of this action, what action should I
[02:08:02] have taken at s to have a better value? The way you enforce that is by trying
[02:08:07] to minimize the TD error. Given this, you  have s’. You compute Q(s’,a) and you find
[02:08:16] the action that should go with s’ that  makes this Q value as high as possible.
[02:08:21] Then you add that to the reward here,  and that gives you your actual target.
[02:08:24] For this current s and a, your Qᵗᵃʳᵍᵉᵗ is this. Now you send back the Qᵗᵃʳᵍᵉᵗ to this transition.
[02:08:36] With this tuple, you pair a Qᵗᵃʳᵍᵉᵗ. Then on the trainer side, you simply
[02:08:43] use supervised learning and minimize your  current network's Q(s, a) with its target.
[02:08:48] Got it. So in the background you're  basically thinking through how valuable
[02:08:54] all these actions actually were. Yeah. In a more optimal policy
[02:08:57] where you're trying to maximize this,  what is the Qᵗᵃʳᵍᵉᵗ of this transition?
[02:09:01] It's sort of like daydreaming. Exactly. You can think about
[02:09:03] it like you're going back in hindsight. Given what I've seen in the historical buffer,
[02:09:11] was there a better action I could have taken? The connection to Go here—I tried and it was
[02:09:16] moderately successful, but too complex to open  source—was replacing this with an MCTS relabeler.
[02:09:27] Instead of doing this target network  computation, you run MCTS on your transition.
[02:09:34] In this case, you have your state, your  action, and whether you won or not at the game.
[02:09:40] Actually, you can just toss those two. You don’t care about these ones.
[02:09:42] You just take your state and plan MCTS to get  your best policy, Π, on your current network.
[02:09:54] Not the network that took this action,  but your current best policy network.
[02:10:00] You rerun your search  offline on these transitions.
[02:10:04] If these are transitions your policy  can get to, this actually acts as
[02:10:08] a very nice stabilizing effect. Another benefit is that you can
[02:10:11] fully saturate your GPU better because you're not  blocking on the Go game to give you board states.
[02:10:18] You simply search across all board  states at any depth in parallel.
[02:10:24] Here the trainer would just predict  the MCTS label as best as possible.
[02:10:28] This kind of works, and it is quite relevant  in robotics where you have a lot of offline
[02:10:33] data and you can't simulate things like MCTS. But in practice, it does run into the problem
[02:10:38] that if the current model is looking at states  it would never reach, it's wasting capacity.
[02:10:45] You have to be a little bit careful here. Much of RL has converged to a much more
[02:10:51] on-policy setup where they don't really  try to directly train on off-policy data.
[02:10:55] At best, they use off-policy  data as a way to reduce variance,
[02:10:58] but not to directly influence the objective. Why have they converged to that?
[02:11:03] It's just more stable. You might use the  off-policy Q as a way to do advantage
[02:11:10] computation, like Q minus the sum of Q. If there are N actions, this is your value,
[02:11:26] and these are your current Q values. Your advantage for that action is
[02:11:29] the average value minus your current one. People can try to estimate Q in an off-policy
[02:11:34] way and then just use advantage here. If there's a problem in these dynamics,
[02:11:40] it doesn't blow up your loss as much. In robotics, there's a convergence
[02:11:45] toward using off-policy data to shape your  rewards but not actually be directly here.
[02:11:51] I'm reminded of our earlier conversation  about why MCTS is so favorable compared to
[02:11:57] the REINFORCE or policy gradient thing LLMs do. This might be totally wrong, but I wrote a blog
[02:12:03] post a few months ago about how policy gradient  RL is even more inefficient than you might think.
[02:12:10] The inefficiency one thinks about naively is the  fact that you have to roll out a whole trajectory
[02:12:16] to get any learning signal at all. As these trajectories become longer
[02:12:20] and longer—as an agent has to do two  days' worth of work to figure out if
[02:12:31] it did a project correctly, rather than just  completing the next word in a sentence—the
[02:12:34] amount of information per FLOP decreases. You have to unroll two days' worth of thinking to
[02:12:41] see if you implemented a feature correctly, so the  amount of samples per FLOP has been decreasing.
[02:12:50] You're trying to maximize as  you’re learning, bits per FLOP.
[02:12:58] You can think of bits per FLOP as  samples per FLOP times bits per sample.
[02:13:14] What I mentioned a second ago is that the samples  per FLOP go down as RL becomes more long-horizon.
[02:13:21] But this kind of naive RL is also terrible  from a bits-per-sample perspective,
[02:13:28] at least compared to supervised learning. Early on in training, let's say you have a
[02:13:34] vocabulary size for an LLM that  is 100K long, so there are 100K
[02:13:39] possible tokens that one could answer. You have a totally untrained model and
[02:13:43] a prompt like, "The sky is…" With supervised  learning, the model would have some probability
[02:13:56] distribution over all the things it could say. There's a label that says the term here is "blue,"
[02:14:01] and it would learn through cross-entropy  loss exactly how far its distribution
[02:14:05] is from correctly saying "blue." If you were doing this through RL,
[02:14:12] the model would try, "The sky is halycon." Nope, that's wrong. "The sky is told." Nope,
[02:14:20] that's wrong. This is a totally untrained model. You would have to do this on the order of 100K
[02:14:25] times just to stumble on "blue"  and get some learning signal.
[02:14:31] In the supervised learning regime, you  have your distribution of probabilities,
[02:14:35] you get told that it's "blue," and  you figure out how far off you were.
[02:14:39] The amount you learn is a  function of your pass rate.
[02:14:44] The further away you are from  "blue," the more you learn to
[02:14:47] go toward "blue" using cross-entropy loss. You can think of it as like your pass rate,
[02:14:52] your prior probability of having said "blue." As a function of that, in supervised learning,
[02:14:58] through cross-entropy loss, you would  learn negative log(p), p being pass rate,
[02:15:05] bits, once you get this label. Whereas in RL, if you're just randomly
[02:15:12] guessing and seeing if it works, that's basically  just the entropy of a binary random variable.
[02:15:25] What's also tough here is that  the distribution you're sampling
[02:15:28] under is your policy's distribution. If your policy has no chance of sampling
[02:15:34] "blue," then you will never get a signal. Exactly. That's modeled by the fact that your
[02:15:41] probability of sampling "blue" is extremely low. If you sample it, you do learn as much as
[02:15:46] you would have in supervised learning. In all other cases—99.99% of the time in
[02:15:51] an untrained model—you're learning  incredibly little from seeing that
[02:15:57] "halycon" or "told" is not the correct word. That's what happens most of the time. You
[02:16:02] learn very little. If you put your pass rate  on the X-axis and the bits you're learning
[02:16:17] from a sample on the Y-axis, with 0%, 50%, and  100%, so at the end of training you're here.
[02:16:28] If you have supervised learning, the negative  log pass rate would look something like this.
[02:16:36] The entropy of a binary random  variable would look like this,
[02:16:46] depending on whether you're doing nats or bits. If you do bits it's one here at the peak.
[02:16:52] This is like a coin flip. You learn the most from a coin
[02:16:54] flip. This is supervised learning. This is RL.  However, the problem is you spend most of training
[02:17:06] in this regime, in the low pass rate regime. How fast you're learning is a function of how
[02:17:14] many bits per sample you're getting, and  you're getting very little signal here.
[02:17:20] If you chart the pass rate on a log scale—where  at the beginning of training with a vocab size of
[02:17:29] 100K the pass rate is 1/100,000, then 1/10,000,  1/1,000, 1/100—what this graph looks like here,
[02:17:45] supervised learning would look like  this, and then RL would look like that.
[02:17:59] And arguably you spend all your time here,  potentially never even getting a single success.
[02:18:06] It's a depressing plot in the  sense that once you're here,
[02:18:10] it's not at all obvious how you get to there. Once you're here you have something,
[02:18:14] but you actually spend all the  time here in many RL problems.
[02:18:19] There's a question of how you initialize  so you're at least at a non-zero pass rate.
[02:18:25] One more thing I'd like to add about  bits per sample that's very relevant to
[02:18:30] any machine learning problem is that there's  a connection to soft targets and distillation.
[02:18:37] If you have access to the logits, not  just the one-hot token answer, if you
[02:18:44] have access to the soft targets the entropy of  this distribution is far higher than the one-hot.
[02:18:53] There's way more information in  bits per sample in a soft label.
[02:18:58] That's why distillation is  so effective per sample.
[02:19:01] It's giving you way more information per sample. I wonder what the equation would be,
[02:19:06] but obviously it's… It would just be the
[02:19:07] entropy of this distribution. The entropy of this is zero.
[02:19:11] The entropy of this is the entropy equation. This is also why AlphaGo is quite beautiful.
[02:19:16] In AlphaGo, you don't train the policy  network to imitate the MCTS action.
[02:19:22] You train it to imitate the MCTS distribution. Both of these are valid, and if you wanted to do
[02:19:27] a scientific experiment of how important this  soft label is, dark knowledge distillation,
[02:19:33] you can run an experiment where you  retrain the policy network on the action
[02:19:37] MCTS selected rather than the soft target. Earlier I was stumbling around. Intuitively,
[02:19:44] why is this ability to do iterative search—where  you don't necessarily need to be able to win the
[02:19:54] game in the beginning, you just need  to be able to improve your current
[02:19:56] policy—so powerful a capability in learning  compared to how LLMs currently learn RL?
[02:20:04] It's exactly this thing of considering  your pass rate of the entire trajectory.
[02:20:10] I just don't know a formal  way to think about this.
[02:20:12] Maybe you should help me out here. Why is AlphaGo an elegant RL algorithm?
[02:20:18] The major reason is that you never have  to initialize at a zero percent success
[02:20:24] rate and solve the exploration problem  of how to get to a non-zero success rate.
[02:20:28] This is what allows you to hill-climb  this beautiful supervised learning signal.
[02:20:32] If you look at the actual implementation  of AlphaGo, every step of the way,
[02:20:36] there's actually no TD error learning or  dynamic programming, at least explicitly.
[02:20:43] It's just supervised learning  on a value classification as
[02:20:47] well as a policy KL minimization. It's just a supervised learning problem
[02:20:53] on improved labels. The training is very stable.  You can train as big of a network as you want.
[02:20:58] You can retrain this on the data set. Everything  will just go stably. The infrastructure
[02:21:02] is very simple to implement as well. You don't need a complex distributed
[02:21:05] system to keep everything on policy. At the end of the day, you're just saying,
[02:21:10] "I have some improved labels. Let's retrain my supervised
[02:21:13] model on these targets." You're always in this
[02:21:16] beautiful regime where you're just trying to  improve the policy, rather than escape local
[02:21:23] minima where every signal is flat all around you. One way to draw the curve is if you draw the win
[02:21:29] rate of an MCTS policy versus the raw network…  Let's say this dotted line is the raw network.
[02:21:35] The MCTS policy looks like this. Every step of the way,
[02:21:40] this supervision signal is very clean. You're never in a situation where the
[02:21:46] MCTS is giving you no signal, unless your  MCTS distribution converges to exactly
[02:21:52] what your policy network predicts. That's a great way to explain it.
[02:22:02] Maybe we sit down and I ask some  questions about automated research.
[02:22:06] One thing I really wanted to talk  to you about is that you did a bunch
[02:22:09] of the research for this project through  this automated LLM coding assistant loop.
[02:22:21] There's an idea that if you fully automated AI  research, you could have some sort of singularity.
[02:22:25] Obviously we're not there yet, but to the  extent that we have early indications of what
[02:22:28] this process might look like, I'm curious about  your observations about what the AI is good at,
[02:22:35] what it's not good at, what you think about  this scenario's likelihood eventually, and what
[02:22:41] thoughts you have about this in general. I think automated scientific research is
[02:22:45] one of the most exciting skills that the  frontier labs are developing right now.
[02:22:50] It's important for everyone who's doing any kind  of research to get a good intuition of what it
[02:22:55] can do now and what it can't, and how the science  process might work in the future once we have AIs
[02:23:00] automating a lot of this investigation. In brief, I mostly used Opus 4.6
[02:23:06] and 4.7 while working on this. What works is that the models can do
[02:23:13] a very good job of hyperparameter optimization. In the past, people would come up with a search
[02:23:18] space of hyperparameters like  learning rate, weight decay,
[02:23:21] and maybe how many layers are in your network. They would do a grid search or a Bayesian
[02:23:26] hyperparameter optimization approach,  and it would find some tuned parameters.
[02:23:31] The really cool thing that automated  coding can do now is search a much
[02:23:38] more open-ended set of problems. It can say, "I've identified that
[02:23:43] the gradients are small in this  layer, so let me change it up here.
[02:23:45] Let me rewrite the code so the data loader  has a new augmentation I came up with.
[02:23:50] Let's try to find the best way to fit the  constraints of the optimization problem."
[02:23:55] You end up with this much more flexible,  high-level, almost grad-student-like
[02:24:00] ability to just grind a performance metric. This can squeeze out quite a lot of performance.
[02:24:06] On a fixed data set with a fixed time budget,  you can improve perplexity by quite a lot on a
[02:24:11] classification problem like LLMs or Go. It is also fantastic now at basically
[02:24:18] executing any experiment. I have a Claude Skill that
[02:24:21] I wrote called Experiment where I give it  a description of what I want it to plot.
[02:24:26] I just describe, "Here's the x-axis I want,  here's the y-axis. Answer this question for
[02:24:30] me." It'll run off and do all the experiments,  compile the plot, make a report, and suggest
[02:24:35] what might have caused it and so forth. That's what works quite well today,
[02:24:40] and I think we can expect these  abilities to get better in the future.
[02:24:42] But it's also useful to know what  it's not doing so well today.
[02:24:47] In the blog version of this tutorial, I have a  plot of all the experiments I did grouped in a
[02:24:54] tree, where every node represents a failed,  successful, or mixed experimental result.
[02:25:00] From there, it branches off into a child  representing the follow-on experiment.
[02:25:03] Occasionally, I'll rabbit-hole down a track like  off-policy MCTS relabeling, do a few experiments,
[02:25:09] and then realize it's probably not worth it. So then I'll jump to a completely different track.
[02:25:13] I call these things rows. What I find is that the  current closed models the public can access today
[02:25:22] don't seem to be that great at selecting what  the next experiment should be in a given track.
[02:25:27] They don't seem to be able to step back and  do the lateral thinking of, "Wait a minute,
[02:25:32] this track doesn't really make sense. Let's go back to first principles and
[02:25:37] think about what the bottleneck might  be, or what we are trying to achieve."
[02:25:41] Often I had to catch infra bugs myself by  prompting the right question to Claude to
[02:25:46] investigate what's causing the discrepancy,  and then it'll answer the question.
[02:25:50] With Mythos-class models or Mythos++ models coming  online, maybe this just completely changes and
[02:25:56] these problems fall to improved scaling. But at the same time, I think there's a
[02:26:02] rich opportunity to develop RL environments that  might incentivize this kind of lateral thinking.
[02:26:08] One of the motivations for setting up this  Go environment was that Go captures a lot
[02:26:13] of very interesting research problems,  often overlapping with LLMs or robotics.
[02:26:18] Yet it's very quick to verify. The outer loop is ultimately:
[02:26:22] does the agent do what I think it does? You can check the outcome of a Go game
[02:26:26] quite easily. The inner loop
[02:26:28] involves all this research engineering around  distributed systems, predicting whether an
[02:26:33] idea is going to work or not, and predicting  the difference a particular modification to
[02:26:38] your training algorithm might make. I think there's a rich library of
[02:26:42] subtasks and sub-environments that you can  train an automated scientist to work on,
[02:26:46] with Go as a sort of outer verification loop. Once you acquire these skills, maybe you can
[02:26:51] apply them to other domains  like biosciences or robotics.
[02:26:55] Or automating AI research. Or automating AI research.
[02:26:58] Which is the real crux, the scary/incredible  thing of making AIs make future versions of AIs.
[02:27:06] You're suggesting the outer loop here  could just be your win rate against KataGo?
[02:27:10] That's one of them. I think there are a lot  of deeper questions that one could tackle.
[02:27:15] For example, let's say you have an idea on how  to improve a scaling-law compute multiplier.
[02:27:23] The outcome isn't necessarily  "achieve the best Go bot ever".
[02:27:28] The outcome might just be, "Can I predict  what the win rate of my Go bot will be?"
[02:27:33] Or, "Can I predict the scaling-law  plots that emerge from my idea?"
[02:27:36] But then you can verify that you haven't  reward-hacked anything by using a very
[02:27:39] verifiable game like Go on the outer loop. I think there are a couple of interesting
[02:27:43] follow-on questions. There are questions
[02:27:45] on the inner loop and the outer loop. On the inner loop, there's a question
[02:27:49] of how locally verifiable any  modification you might make is.
[02:27:54] That is to say, would you know  whether some idea you try out is
[02:27:58] actually an improvement or a degradation? Would you know if something isn't working
[02:28:02] as a result of a bug, or is it the  result of the idea itself being wrong?
[02:28:08] Ilya was talking about how one of the things he  thinks makes him a good researcher is that he has
[02:28:21] a strong belief in what the correct idea is. He's able to persevere through bugs and know
[02:28:30] which things are bugs versus mistakes in the  fundamental idea, based on his high-level belief
[02:28:34] that "this idea should work, so therefore there  has to be a bug", versus the other way around.
[02:28:38] Why don't we start with that question? How locally verifiable are things
[02:28:42] which are good ideas? As in the case of the
[02:28:46] success story for deep learning, you can  think about this as a decades-long idea
[02:28:50] that took a lot of faith to get it to work. This presents a very challenging long-horizon
[02:28:57] RL problem where every step of the way you have  a committee telling you that this is a bad idea,
[02:29:03] and then ultimately you break through. How do you design RL environments that
[02:29:09] maybe give you some feedback earlier? I think this is a very tough open
[02:29:15] question that I don't have an answer to. Ultimately, to play a very strong Go bot,
[02:29:20] you probably did need to discover deep learning. Having a challenging game that cannot be cheated
[02:29:30] easily on the outer loop could be used as  an outer-loop signal for something like
[02:29:35] discovering the principles of deep learning. Now, of course, to make it tractable—and this
[02:29:39] is where research taste really matters—you  have to come up with ways to initialize
[02:29:44] your problem so that you don't try  to solve a very intractable problem.
[02:29:49] Maybe you can leverage LLMs as a  universal grammar in the middle to
[02:29:54] give you some sort of local feedback. The fact that LLMs are a universal
[02:29:58] grammar means that they can move  at almost any level of the stack.
[02:30:02] They can think very locally, as well as  step back and think in very broad steps.
[02:30:07] I think that's where a lot of the lateral  thinking ability of humans comes from:
[02:30:12] knowing when the track you're pursuing or  the objective you're pursuing is not right,
[02:30:15] and you should be asking a different question. The other question is how stackable local
[02:30:20] improvements are in the attempt to get  to a better result on the outer loop.
[02:30:25] I've heard rumors that at some AI labs,  the thing that has gone wrong is that
[02:30:29] people will individually pursue good ideas,  but those don't end up stacking well, and so
[02:30:34] the training run fails because of some weird  interaction between two seemingly good ideas.
[02:30:40] Having a single top-down vision of how  things should work is very important.
[02:30:44] Having worked at different AI labs and  also played around with parallel agents
[02:30:50] trying different ideas, what's your sense  of how parallelizable AI innovation is?
[02:30:55] Great question. I think the research taste  for executing well on the Bitter Lesson is
[02:31:03] that you need to know how much the Bitter  Lesson can buy you and how much is too much
[02:31:09] to ask for, at any given moment. Of course, in the fullness of time
[02:31:13] compute is the single most important  determinant of how things work.
[02:31:20] It's almost inevitable that as you scale  up energy and compute and parameters,
[02:31:24] intelligence will just fall out of that. That's  super beautiful, super profound. No algorithmic
[02:31:29] detail really matters beyond that. But in the present day, we don't
[02:31:33] have infinite compute and parameters and  arbitrarily good initialization, so we
[02:31:37] have to come up with heuristics that give us that. These heuristics are probably somewhat redundant.
[02:31:44] That's probably why you see this  effect where a lot of these compute
[02:31:47] multipliers don't necessarily stack. They might have some correlated benefit.
[02:31:52] And then three years down the line,  when the Nvidia GPUs have gotten even
[02:31:56] stronger, maybe they stack even less well. Maybe at any given point in time, the benefit
[02:32:03] of any given compute multiplier is transitory,  which is what I suspected with the KataGo paper.
[02:32:08] There were many algorithmic ideas applied, and  then you can see that with modern Blackwell GPUs
[02:32:14] and Ada-class GPUs—which are much better than the  V100-grade GPUs that that paper used—some of these
[02:32:21] algorithmic tricks to speed up convergence just  don't matter so much compared to something else.
[02:32:26] I think that's a matter of  taste in the present time.
[02:32:30] How about the outer loop? How  verifiable for making AI smarter?
[02:32:37] With Go, you do have this outer loop of win rate  against the best open-source model out there.
[02:32:43] Even there, as you were saying, there are other  outer loops of whether you discovered a new
[02:32:48] phenomenon, which is actually very hard to…. If you didn't know scaling laws were
[02:32:53] important… When were Chinchilla  or Kaplan scaling laws released?
[02:32:56] 2018. So if you're back in 2015, there's
[02:33:00] not an automated procedure one can easily imagine  for knowing which paper is the scaling laws paper
[02:33:07] versus which is just another random plot. Even in the Go case, it's a hard-to-verify
[02:33:12] outer loop, and the whole idea of an outer  loop is to have some backstop on improvement,
[02:33:21] let alone for general AGI, where of course we  have a bunch of these benchmarks. But there's
[02:33:27] a problem. We know the things we can measure,  and we improve on the things we can measure.
[02:33:32] We care about this broader ability  to do economically useful work,
[02:33:35] which is not super easy to measure, at  least until you automate everything.
[02:33:42] There's a question of how good  the outer verification loop is
[02:33:47] for AI self-improvement, and does that matter? I'm going to give a non-rigorous argument,
[02:33:53] but one that I intuitively believe. DeepMind started with a focus on games.
[02:34:00] They used games as their outer loop, and then  their researchers learned from the experience
[02:34:06] of solving games, and now they're working on LLMs. Presumably, there was some positive transfer from
[02:34:11] their time working on games and Atari and Go and  StarCraft that now helps them make good LLMs.
[02:34:19] I assume that there's positive transfer  in some regard, whether it's coding or
[02:34:22] general research ability or project management. All these things probably help them do well.
[02:34:31] If that's the case, why wouldn't it also  be true for automated AI researchers?
[02:34:36] They should be able to positively transfer  experience tackling quick-to-verify,
[02:34:41] quick-to-iterate environments to something  more ambitious and economically useful,
[02:34:45] like automating drug discovery. I don't know. Isn't the issue…
[02:34:51] Historically, until Gemini 3 or whatever a  couple years ago, people were saying, "Look,
[02:34:58] Google isn't catching up in LLMs because  they're too tied to the old approach."
[02:35:06] There are gains, but there are also ways in which  it actively hinders you. It's not obvious to me.
[02:35:14] The jury's still out. Let's say  currently Google's doing quite well.
[02:35:20] Who knows if the initialization of training on  games is ultimately going to hobble their ability
[02:35:25] to be the winner in the long term. It's hard to say for sure.
[02:35:32] Likewise, who knows if the seeming late  start was really just them pre-training
[02:35:37] for longer on how to scale up TPUs. They invested all their tech tree in
[02:35:42] getting TPUs to be good, which seemed not that  useful in the short term but in the long term
[02:35:46] it becomes… So it's even hard for humans to  reason about what the optimal research strategy
[02:35:51] should be, even with the data we have today. Okay, we should let people know how they can
[02:35:59] find out more about this project, whether to fork  it themselves, or check out your blog post where
[02:36:04] you do an excellent job explaining many  of these ideas. Where do people go next?
[02:36:09] My website is evjang.com. There's a blog post that  links to an interactive version of this tutorial.
[02:36:16] On my GitHub, which is the username ericjang,  there's an AutoGo repo that people can fork
[02:36:22] and reproduce the training results. I also highly recommend people check
[02:36:25] out this blog post, "As Rocks May Think." We touched on some of the ideas in this
[02:36:28] conversation, but it's this grander thesis of what  happens when you have thinking as a primitive in—
[02:36:38] Computer science. Exactly. I highly recommend
[02:36:41] people check out that blog post as well. I encourage the audience to think about
[02:36:45] the relationship between thinking and Go via  MCTS and search, and how it relates to LLMs.
[02:36:51] I think there's something quite profound there,  and probably underexplored just because Go has
[02:36:56] been relatively underexplored  compared to the boom in LLMs.
[02:36:59] It's not to say that I think we should  have trees in our LLMs, but there is
[02:37:04] some very interesting duality between them. You can actually do a lot of research on Go,
[02:37:09] MCTS, and reasoning with very small  budgets. So that's very exciting.
[02:37:14] Awesome, Eric. Thanks for doing this. Thank you. It's an honor to be on the podcast.
